I mentioned in [a post](http://www.roundcrisis.com/2016/02/13/Database-programming/) yesterday that I was looking for at a minimum:

- Programming language name
- When it first appeared (anywhere outside of someone's mind)
- Designer and anyone else involved and level of involved
- some tags (ie paradigm, typed or untyped?, etc)
- Influenced by / influenced.

I got some good responses on twitter. The one closest was this one from [Dmitry Geurkov (@dgeurkov)](https://twitter.com/dgeurkov/status/698668794328322050)

Where he links to this visualisation, which lead to the [freebase db](http://www.freebase.com/computer/programming_language), this is very close to what I was looking for. There is also a need to be able to amplify this need.
Make sure to follow the source as you can click on the nodes to see the influence of any language shown there.

[Scott Wlaschin](http://scottwlaschin.com/) sent me some great links to this graph from the great book: Concepts, techniques and Models of computer graphics (which has an accompanying [MOOC in case you are interested](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:LouvainX+Louv1.1x+3T2015/29e6c993b0e84e2aace97846677d0d48/))
