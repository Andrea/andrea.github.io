DDD8  was a lot of fun!




I really didn't know what to expect and it turned out great, and got to a few talks ( not as many as I wanted tho) and met personally a lot of really interesting people.




Moving on swiftly to the meaty bit of the post:







I've  uploaded the code and slides to [github](http://github.com/Andrea/LessonsLearnedInUnitTesting), I m hoping I can improve this samples with time, if there is anything wrong apologies in advance, first time using git as a committing to a project so I m bound to get it wrong. Looking forward to James Gregory E-Van on git so I can learn more on the topic :).




I'm sure I ll look at the code sometime later and think OMG! how did I dare to present this in public, but I guess is the nature of the beast :).







If you saw the talk please let me know what you think, as I would appreciate any feedback, particularly the parts that I can make better. So far I the feedback I have is:








	
  * I do speak too quick,

	
  * I should talk about legacy code and how to deal with that










I posted the code in the same way I presented it, this means there is a OrderService_version1, 2 and 3, hopefully you can follow the code pretty much as we did it in the talk.







There was some  questions, and I said I ll post some links here:




**Books**:




- [The Art of Unit Testing](http://www.artofunittesting.com/) (Roy Osherove),  the talk is heavily inspired by this book




- [xUnit Test Patterns, Refactoring Test Code](http://xunitpatterns.com/) ( Meszaros), Great book if you are looking for more detail. Perfect as a reference book




-[ TDD by Example](http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530) by Kent Beck, a very hands on approach highly recomended.




- [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052), Michael Feathers - A must read if you are interested in testing (whether you are working with legacy code or not).







**Tools**:




During the talk I was using







Unit testing frameworks:




-[xUnit](http://www.codeplex.com/xunit)




-[nUnit](http://www.nunit.org/)




Mocking Frameworks:




-[moq](http://code.google.com/p/moq/)







Other tools  mentioned:







-[Rhino  Mocks](http://github.com/ayende/rhino-mocks): Possibly the most used Mocking Framework




-[NCommon](http://github.com/riteshrao/ncommon/): General purpose library, definitely worth a check




-[Ninject](http://github.com/enkari/ninject/): IoC container ( there is also .. Ninject.MVC that helps you wire up the dependencies of your controllers on they fly, very useful )




-[Windsor](http://www.castleproject.org/castle/download.html): IoC container










If there are any questions or comments, please do let me know







Thanks to the organizers and everyone there, it was a wonderful experience that I m hoping to repeat.




Cheers
