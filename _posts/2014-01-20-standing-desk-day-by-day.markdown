I decided to keep a mini journal with updates about having a standing desk, I figure a lot of people are thinking about it (like I was) and it might be handy to have this information.

## Day 1
Today is the first day I am using as standing desk as described in [this article][lifehacker]. It's been exciting "building" this.

I used the desk without the shelf for about 4.5 hours two days ago and I was tired (though I had a long run before that, so that might be the reason). I used it without the shelf

Today is officially the first full day and I am finding that having the shelf really helps, also I'm feeling less tension in by upper back than usual. I got this square cushion as well for standing on it (no shoes), and I think it's more comfortable, compared to standing with runners.

I noticed I tend to shift on my feet at lot, probably that's good for circulation.

After about 3 hours I sat down for lunch (it felt great)

I'll update at the end of the day

Had a planning meeting for 3 hours (I was sitting down)
