F#n and games 


I am extremely happy to announce that I will be going about North America showing off some F# and games! 

I will  in the following user groups

* Tuesday 23rd September - Nashville  [NashFP](http://nashfp.org/)
* Wednesday 24th September - Washington DC 
* Tuesday 30th September - Toronto 


## Game on!

I think that people learn certain things better when there is interaction. To that end we will be using Duality (an open source game engine) with a F# plugin (also OSS) to create power-ups (or power downs? ) to [Breakout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)).

I think I will be attending the amazing [F# Progressive tutorials](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/1886-progressive-f-tutorials-nyc-2014) in New York, the line up is pretty good, and suitable for both beginners and advanced f#ers.

## More Game at GameCraft

On the 4th October at GameCenter NYU I'll be at [New York GameCraft](https://www.gamecraft.it/events/new-york-gamecraft-2014/). In this event you have 10 hours to start and finish a game with a given theme (the theme is announced on the day). You can use any technology you want. If you never took part on a game jam I would recommend you do. The first question I get generally is skills do I need? you need to want to make a game, and quite possibly a laptop. [Phil Trelford](http://trelford.com/blog/category/GameCraft.aspx) is no stranger to GameCraft and wrote a lot about it in his blog. Attendance is free but you need to [register]((https://www.gamecraft.it/events/new-york-gamecraft-2014/)) . Thanks to SkillsMatters and Game Center NYU for helping make this event happen.  


I will be updating the details of the times here as I learn about it. I hope to see you there! 

Thanks to [fsharpWorks](http://fsharpworks.com/) for Sponsoring this trip!
