title: Interesting learning resources - December 2025
categories:
- software architecture
- iteration zero
- ddd
excerpt: "These resources span from practical case studies in team scaling to theoretical frameworks for understanding programming languages, unified by a common thread: how we structure our thinking to solve hard problems. Whether examining ProTime's journey from feature teams to domain-owned teams, exploring different approaches to teaching programming concepts, or critically evaluating the models that shape our decision-making, each resource helps navigating the experience of building software.."

## The Early History of F#

[pdf](https://github.com/dsyme/dsyme-presentations/blob/master/2021-06-21-hopl/the-early-history-of-fsharp-given.pdf)
This paper presents Don Syme's perspective on the history of F#, structured around six key narratives. Syme describes how F# emerged from the collision between strongly-typed functional programming traditions and the object-oriented tidal wave of the 1980s-90s, particularly within Microsoft's ecosystem. He explains how F# was born from an "obsessive compulsion" to ensure functional programming remained viable in the 2000s, starting with OCaml's core but adapting it to interoperate with .NET's industrial virtual machine and ecosystem.
The presentation highlights how F# successfully resolved several contradictions within the functional programming community by introducing innovative features like functional objects, active patterns, and computation expressions. These additions allowed F# to maintain its functional core while becoming practical for real-world development, ultimately influencing many modern programming languages including C#, Scala, TypeScript, and others. Syme emphasizes that the "golden thread" of strongly-typed functional programming - exemplified by simple constructs like let f x = (x, x) - has remained constant from the 1970s through today and will continue to appeal to programmers in the future.


### Code Review Can Be Better by matklad

This is a common pattern most of us use when reviewing code

> When I review code, I like to pull the source branch locally. Then I soft-reset the code to mere base, so that the code looks as if it was written by me. Then I fire up magit, which allows me to effectively navigate both through the diff, and through the actual code. And I even use git staging area to mark files I’ve already reviewed

> Alas, when I want to actually leave feedback on the PR, I have to open the browser, navigate to the relevant line in the diff, and (after waiting for several HTTP round-trips) type my suggestion into a text area.
