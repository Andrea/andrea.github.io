Possibly what blew my mind the most last year was attending and presenting at [CodeMesh][cm], the conference line-up was impeccable, and of course, the interesting bits happened when talking to people there. Kudos to the organizers for a great conference.

Below please find my slides, they probably make no sense without context. I think the interesting parts of the talk are better explained in two posts about game concurrency [here][c1] and [here][c2]

David Turner's talk is available via this paper ["Some history of Functional Programming Languages"][fk]

Parallella Board, [website][pb] 

Yan Cui's [slides][yc]

Phil Trelford's [video on F# for Trading][ptre], to be honest, even if you are not into trading, this is pretty good.

The talk by Dave Thomas and Jose Valim was pretty cool, no video or slides available at the moment :D.
