I understand the title makes little sense, but this is probably what I would search in a web search engine ( hopefully at the time I ll find my own post)  A short, unordered list of things I install when I get a new machine/wipped machine






  * An FTP client Filezilla will do


  * Firefox + Add on: firebug, noscript, colurful tabs,


  * Chrome ( for js intensive stuff it jsut renders faster)


  * ieTester ( run multiple ie versions parallely)


  * ieDebuger


  * Wireshark, comes handy


  * Reflector


  * Resharper


  * Syntax friendly  Notepad ( I use Notepad ++  but not mad about it)


  * Tortoisesvn or Anksvn 


  * Tortoise git


  * SVN Monitor


  * Git ( you ll need it at least to download libraries code)


  * foobar2000 music player ( after all you need to block the noise from the outside)


  * Sql Server Management Studio , you ll eventually need it  and if you have profiler you ll probably need it too


  * #Develop is kinda handy too


  * I use Evernote, so I would install that, tho not run it often just because I don't  like the desktop client much tbh


  * Sumatra PDF (if anyone knows a better one I d appreciate it)


  * Visual Studio


  * Setup IIS
