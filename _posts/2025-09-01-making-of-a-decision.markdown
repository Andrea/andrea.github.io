This series goes over the topics described in [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ie97Oe-t8Wk). If this is a format you prefer.


Just shy of 30 years ago, I had a great opportunity that might have changed my life, at least in terms of education and work opportunities. The decision, ultimately outside my control, didn't go my way.  I've come to understand my family's reasoning better with time, but at that time it felt ...not great. 
One of the things that helped me at the time was programming. You could basically create something and any limitations were, especially at the time, self-inflicted. It's definitely one of the nicest things about programming computers: you can create something out of nothing.

As I've worked on bigger and more complicated projects with added difficulty and bigger teams, making anything becomes harder. After all:

> Coordination is not free; the more systems (of software or people) need to interact to make change, the higher the cost.

Decision-making is an essential part of building systems, and people dynamics come into the fold, no matter how much we want them to or not. Decision-making is an activity that involves a lot of people, in all types of organisations.

> "These decisions are a record of the power structures and the feedback loops that got it there." -Andrew Harmel-Law

Very often, crucial decisions deviate from expectations and this has a negative effect. Why is that? This led me to examine what makes a decision happen.

To make decisions about their systems, people generally need sufficient context on their software and people systems and the capability to change those systems somehow. Speaking in imprecise terms, one could say that this is all about knowledge and power.

In my experience of learning and talking about it, **power is uncomfortable to discuss but essential to understand**: learning about power is essential to be effective, to be taken seriously and to not be taken advantage of.

There are two key definitions of power:

**Power With** (Mary Parker Follett): "The ability to make things happen, to be a causal agent, to initiate change."
**Power Over**: "The ability to make others do as you would have them do."

### Sources of Power

I found the treatment from "The Dawn of Everything" most complete and relatable. The book is about a lot more than this, but the relevant part here is that the sources of power, when transposing over current organisations, would be something like: authority, charisma, and access to knowledge.

**Authority**: In organisations this manifests as economic coercion rather than physical force. It's the power to fire, demote, or economically punish employees. It also manifests in access control. HR departments and security functions institutionalise this form of control, creating systems of compliance through the implied threat of economic harm.

**Charisma** operates through leadership appeal, inspirational vision, and personal influence networks. This manifests in leaders who can motivate and direct others through force of personality, compelling vision, or personal magnetism—regardless of their formal position in the hierarchy.

**Access to Knowledge** appears as information asymmetry and knowledge-based authority. Higher levels in a company hierarchy control strategic information, financial data, and decision-making processes. One can also gain or access power through specialised knowledge. It is possible to create bureaucratic gatekeeping around information flow, also information hiding. This mirrors bureaucracy as a form of control over information, as described in "The Dawn of Everything".

### Laws of Power

There are many books with titles such as: "The n Laws of Power" or similar; they tend to be books about exercising influence, which can be useful. What I'm looking for when I read about this is understanding why and when power flows. So far I've found this to be a useful set.

* Power is dynamic. One thing you know for sure is that it will keep changing.
* Power is like water. Eric Liu's metaphor of how power is like water and your organisation is the sponge is very memorable.  
> power is like water. It flows all around us at all times. Sometimes it takes the liquid form of politics-in-action, a turbulent flow with crosscurrents and strong undertows. Sometimes it takes the solid form of settled law: policy is power frozen. Sometimes it is like vapor in the air, invisibly shaping the climate and our behavior in just the way beliefs or ideology or emotions do.
* Power compounds: If you have power you tend to get more power. Small exercises of power create capacity for larger ones.
