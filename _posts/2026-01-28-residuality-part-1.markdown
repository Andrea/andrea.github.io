This document describes a first experience using Residuality. The goal is to share what happened and what it questions it raised and record what it felt like for us.

* insert context about what is residuality
* insert more info about what we are doing Contextive as a baseline 
* add more about Chris' and mine background

## First Session about Residuality

The session began with a review of the architecture. This step felt slow and rushed at the same time (explain better)
What the naïve/inital architecture?  We decided that the naïve architecture is simply what is currently written.

During the creation of the stressors list, C.S. mentioned feeling as though he had to defend his decisions or clarify that certain design considerations had already been addressed. 
Bounded contexts appeared during the conversation, though they were not the primary focus.

##  Observations

The slow architectural review raised questions about preparation. It was unclear how much detail is necessary at the start and whether different preparation approaches would make the session smoother.

The decision about the naïve architecture highlighted how ambiguous this concept can feel when first learning the practice. It raised questions about how teams should define it and whether different interpretations affect the outcome.

The moment of defensiveness suggested that the exercise can surface emotional dynamics. It raised questions about how to create an environment where inquiry does not feel like evaluation.

Bounded contexts mentioned

### Questions

* how to prepare effectively? 
* how to define the naïve architecture,
* how to handle emotional reactions during the exercise, and how DDD concepts should be integrated?
* These remain open areas rather than conclusions.

* What level of architectural preparation supports the exercise without slowing it down?
* How should bounded contexts be discussed?

## Conclusion

Comments and questions are welcome. The goal is to learn together and understand how this practice fits into real architectural wor
