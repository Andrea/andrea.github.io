I ran a workshop with [Tech Waka Podcast & Leadership Collective in Auckland](https://www.meetup.com/tech-leaders-collective/) on the 26th March. 
It was great to get hands on with my new local community!

Thanks everyone that came over and worked hard during this [workshop](https://www.meetup.com/tech-leaders-collective/events/306442951/)
