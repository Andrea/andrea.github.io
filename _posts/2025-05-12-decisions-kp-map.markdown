This is a post about understanding what is happening during architectural decision making. 
Following up from the talk I did at ADA Conf I started working on a mapping tool to help me see and reason what we discussed
It's called Decision KP Map. 

> Decision KP Map is a mapping tool that helps visualise the **subjective** perception of the community that enables decision making.The **Key People**, in terms of their **Knowledge and Power**. Both concepts together are the source of KP in the name, key people and their knowledge and power.

If you are interested in learning more about it, please see this [Introducing Decision KP Maps]({% post_url 2026-01-22-making-of-a-decision-5 %})

I'm currently running a trial to see how it performs. If you are interested please contact me via mastodon, linkedIn or Bluesky.
