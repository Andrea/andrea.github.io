  <h1>About</h1>
<p>I am a developer that makes games, at the moment  Onikira:Demon Killer. I like to learn how to do things in different ways, in the hope that one day I will have to do nothing and just do things because I can. </p>
<p>Conferences and meetups are a great way to learn more, so I try to help when I can to make them happen.</p>
<p>I worked on enterprise (not the one with Piccard sadly) for too many years and then we created the company where we now make games, the future unknown.</p>
