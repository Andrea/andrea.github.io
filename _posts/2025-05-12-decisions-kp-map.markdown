This is a post about understanding what is happening during architectural decision making. 
Following up from the talk I did at ADA Conf I started working on something to help me see and reason what we discussed
It's called Decision KP Map. 
I'm currently running a trial to see how it performs. If you are interested please contact me via mastodon, linkedIn or Bluesky.


Thanks [Dawn Ahukanna](https://mastodon.social/@dahukanna), [Kenny Baas-Schwegler](https://weave-it.org/) , [Andrew Harmel-Law](https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/) and many others that have already given feedback and tried this.
