Some cool posts (not new) 

* [Having fun with type level numbers by using a type provider](http://gettingsharper.de/2014/12/19/having-fun-with-type-level-numbers-using-a-type-provider/)
Excellent post that I have been meaning to read about implementing a type provider for primer numbers, complete with the explanation on primes and type provider implementation. Really the *making illegal states unrepresentable* .

* [Nested looping to programmatic depth in F#](http://latkin.org/blog/2014/12/26/nested-looping-to-programmatic-depth-in-f/) This post comes to a solution to the lack of _break_ and _return_ in F## by solving the similar problem we did in a recent [Functional Kats meetup](http://www.meetup.com/FunctionalKats/events/225465966/) The first time I thought when I saw the problem was, oh this is about [Computation expressions](fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/computation-expressions-intro/) but although there is a link to a solution by Tomas Petricek that [uses them](http://tomasp.net/blog/imperative-i-return.aspx/) this post shows a different approach that shows better performance 66ms versus 880ms.
