I am sorry for boring titles. After the last post I figured the For and Yield needed some extra clearing up.

This is post is not part of the [#FsAdvent](https://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/tag/fsadvent/), so if you are reading this you should go and check it out. Ready for some more computation expressions?

This post is the final part in a three part series about computation expressions

1.[Computaion expressions in practice](http://www.roundcrisis.com/2015/12/06/Computation-expressions-in-practice/) Introduces definition and parts of a computation expression, and a simple example.
2.[More computation expressions](http://www.roundcrisis.com/2015/12/06/more-computation-expressions/). Examples of a maybe monad and monoids with computation expressions

### How to draw a horse

In the previous post I left hanging exacly how things work and I thought that was a little unfair, a little like:

### Recap

So, the monoid computaton expression looked like this:

{% highlight FSharp%}

type MonoidBuilder ()=
  member this.Zero() = neutral

  member this.Combine(x, y) = addColour x y

  member x.For(sequence, body) =
      let combine a b = x.Combine(a, body b)
      let Z = x.Zero()
      Seq.fold combine Z sequence

  member x.Yield (a) = a

let monoid = new MonoidBuilder()

let monoidAdd xs= monoid {
     for x in xs do
       yield x
     }

{% endhighlight %}

#### Zero

Zero is one of those functions that are quite useful, it runs when

* Have an if expression with no else
* There is nothing else on the block

For example, the following

{% highlight FSharp%}

type ZeroBuilder ()=
  member this.Zero() =
    printfn "from Zero"

let zero = ZeroBuilder()

let test = zero{
	  printfn "not much going on"
	}

{% endhighlight %}


See you next time
