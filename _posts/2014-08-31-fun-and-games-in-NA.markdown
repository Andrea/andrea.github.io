F#n and games 


I am extremely happy to announce that after [Strange Loop](https://thestrangeloop.com/schedule) a conference I am lucky to attend!. I will be going about North America showing off some F# and games! 

I will  in the following user groups

* Tuesday 23rd September - Nashville  [NashFP](http://nashfp.org/)
* Wednesday 24th September - Washington DC 
* Tuesday 30th September - Toronto 

I will be updating the details of the times here as I learn about it. I hope to see you there! 

## Game on!

It is way more entertaining to learn by doing. To that end we will be using [Duality](https://github.com/bravesirandrew/duality) (an open source game engine) with a F# plug-in (also OSS) to create power-ups (or power downs? ) to [Breakout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)).

It is very possible I'll be attending the amazing [F# Progressive tutorials](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/1886-progressive-f-tutorials-nyc-2014) in New York, the line up is pretty good, and suitable for both beginners and advanced f#ers. If you are close and into functional programming, this looks like a great conference and Don Syme, Scott Wlashin, Rachel Resse and more involved in it.

## More Game at GameCraft

On October the 4th at GameCenter NYU  [New York GameCraft](https://www.gamecraft.it/events/new-york-gamecraft-2014/) is happening. In this 12 hour event, you have 10 hours to start and finish a game with a given theme (the theme is announced on the day), in case you are wondering the extra 2 hours is to play each other games and get prizes!. 
You can use any technology you want. 
If you never took part on a game jam I would recommend you do, the first question I get generally is: What skills do I need? you need to want to make a game, and quite possibly a laptop. [Phil Trelford](http://trelford.com/blog/category/GameCraft.aspx) is no stranger to GameCraft and wrote a lot about it in his blog. 
Attendance is free but you need to [register]((https://www.gamecraft.it/events/new-york-gamecraft-2014/)) . Thanks to SkillsMatters and Game Centre NYU for helping make this event happen.
