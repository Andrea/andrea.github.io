  <h1>About</h1>
<p>I am a developer that makes games, at the moment  <a href="http://www.onikira.com" target=_blank>Onikira:Demon Killer</a> for PC and soon Consoles . 
<p>Most of our code is C# with some F# sprinkled in for good measure . </p>
<p>
I really enjoy finding different ways to write code, sometimes for performance, other times for succinctness, sometimes, just because you can, there is no better way to learn than trying.</p>
<p>
When I am not working I tend to play with Haskell or other languages or cats 
</p>
<p>
Conferences and meetups are a great way to learn more, so I try to help when I can to make them happen. For that reason I co-organise Functional Kats and GameCraft. I also speak at local and international conferences like CodeMesh, Progressive.Net, ProF#, Build Stuff and many more.</p>
<p>
I worked on enterprise (not the one with Piccard sadly) for what feels like too many years and then we created the company where we now make games, the future unknown.</p>
