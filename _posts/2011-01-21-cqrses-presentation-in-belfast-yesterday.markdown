I was in Belfast yesterday were I was presenting what I called "CQRS/ES and friends" in [NIMTUG ](http://nimtug.org/). I had a great time thanks to all who came and thanks to the organizers.

I would normally post here my presentation, but not sure its of any value, as it doesnt have much info, I use it for helping me remember what to say, if anyone want it, i can definetly post it, just add a comment here.

The code I was showing is a fork of  [Super Simple CQRS code example](https://github.com/gregoryyoung/m-r) by Gregg Young

I have a link (bit.ly bundle) with a bunch of links about CQRS and ES, including a few other sample code bases  [http://bit.ly/9LC877](http://bit.ly/9LC877)

If you have any questions, or feedback good or bad (something missing?) please let me know by posting a comment here (if you don't want me to publish it just say so )

Thanks for coming :)
