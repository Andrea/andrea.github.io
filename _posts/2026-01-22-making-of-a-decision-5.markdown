### Decision KP Map

Decision KP Map is a mapping tool that helps visualise the subjective perception of the community of decision makers, the Key People,  in terms of their Knowledge and Power. 

It’s a map where you can place your subjective understanding of where people sit in terms of:
* How much accepted knowledge they can access and,
* How much change they are able to effect. 

A Decision KP Map always has a specific context, for example an architectural decision. Over the course of a decision, one would generate multiple maps. People can be added or removed as needed.

* 🗒️ Blog post: [The making of a decision Part 5 - Introducing Decision KP Map] - this will be updated when it's posted. I have created this mapping tool after when in the context of making decisions I started mapping this way. After doing this a few times, I realised that this format might be useful to others and I asked many people to test it, I had positive feedback. The post goes will cover all that.

#### Why use this tool, in the context of better decision making

* Understand what happened during an exchange (e.g. a meeting). An easy to learn tool that helps evaluate your [ladder of inference][argyris]
* Teach people new to leadership how to navigate decisions. Many people who write code (roles and titles vary) enter decision‑making with a significant level of technical knowledge but limited understanding of how the rest of the decision‑making process works. This tool can help them.
