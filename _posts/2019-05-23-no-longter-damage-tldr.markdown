A week trying to generate the least amount of long lived rubbish by not buying non renewable things. My rules are:

* Focus only on things I buy or consume directly.
* From Monday 20/05 till Sunday 26/05 evening.
* Document what I do buy and questions that arise from this experiment.

For previous days:

* [Day 1](http://www.roundcrisis.com/2019/05/20/no-longter-damage-1/)
* [Day 2](http://www.roundcrisis.com/2019/05/21/no-longter-damage-2/)
* [Day 3](http://www.roundcrisis.com/2019/05/22/no-longer-damage-3/)
* [Day 4](http://www.roundcrisis.com/2019/05/23/no-longter-damage-4/)
* [Day 5](http://www.roundcrisis.com/2019/05/24/no-longer-damage-5/)
* [Day 6](http://www.roundcrisis.com/2019/05/25/no-longer-damage-6/)
* [Day 7](http://www.roundcrisis.com/2019/05/26/no-longer-damage-7/)

## Gotchas so far

* Individually wrapped tea, wrappers are not recyclable, and the tea bags have plastic. Awaiting answers from [Veolia](https://twitter.com/silverSpoon/status/1131620052451635201).
* Severely reduced lunch options. Most of the take away options come in some form of plastic, in the end a hot wrap wrapped in paper from Pret did the trick but at the cost of changing my diet.
* I emailed [TossedUK](https://tosseduk.com/) about being able to use my own container and they said yes (meaning I need to carry my container with me, which is fine).
* It seems my council doesn't support composting of paper kitchen towels but do allow composting of tea bags (which contain plastic). I emailed them to check.
* Taxis and car rides in general, not sure how to calculate the impact from an emissions point of view. If anyone has good links, I am all ears.
* Hot drinks seem like a very tricky thing to get whilst being environmentally friendly.
* Yay for food you can grow yourself. Even if it is just a small percentage of what we eat.
* It is looking like it is really hard to dispose of biscuits wrappers, there is a way to reuse(?) them some how via Terracycle, but I was not able to find out any specifics as to how to do this exactly.
* There was a note on a plastic container about how you can bring this to a big store, my nearest one is about 5 miles from here, which I would probably have to drive to, especially If I am buying more food there.  I wonder if the home delivery would take this instead.
* Can anything be done about these things that are not recyclable? How could we upcycle them?
* I heard (but not researched yet) that there is some rubbish you can bring back to where you bought it and they will deal with it, but I don't understand if that is true or what does "deal with it" means? 
* How does the Pet process work? There is some information [here](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/recycling-polyethylene-terephthalate-pet-2877869). Definitely a step in the right direction but given the urgency of the situation with the environment it seems like not enough.
* What are good alternatives for meat wrapping? Are there any secure alternatives?
* Are there alternative ways to source spinach and other vegetables that come in film wrapping? 
* It is good to know about the sourcing of the materials as well as the recycling capabilities. Some packages have [Fsc label](https://ic.fsc.org/en/choosing-fsc/fsc-labels).

## All the rubbish in one place

Of the kind we can see:
