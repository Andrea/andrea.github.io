Saw [this ](http://ajaxian.com/archives/iepngfix-2-now-supports-css-background-position-and-repeat)on ajaxian and i think is really handy and at some (not too far in time i ll need this)  
[http://www.twinhelix.com/css/iepngfix/demo/](http://www.twinhelix.com/css/iepngfix/demo/) basically to add some transparency you just add a few files to your sever and a line of css and thats it.  
Will tell when the time to use this comes :)
