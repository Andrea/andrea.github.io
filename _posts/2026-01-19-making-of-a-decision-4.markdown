### Bytesize Architecture Sessions
#### Overview

Bytesize Architecture Sessions are a workshop format that helps teams understand the systems they work on. Each session focuses on a small slice of a system. After some sessions your team will become consistent in the understanding of their systems, grow a common vocabulary and ultimately build tools to design the future together.

Bytesize Architecture sessions are used in decision-making to facilitate collaborative software design through a structured workshop format that prioritises shared understanding. This approach involves small groups of eight to ten people engaging in repeated one-hour modelling sessions

Using these sessions is like assembling a map of the territory where every team member holds a different piece of the landscape. By sketching their sections individually first, less detail is lost before converging them into a single, improved guide for the journey ahead.

#### Why use this tool, in the context of better decision making

* Practice that is easy to learn and introduce. Not a big time investment for knowledge sharing
* Alone together is an enabler when it comes to hearing ideas at the same volume
• Resetting Power Dynamics: One of the most significant reasons to use these sessions is the "Alone Together". By having participants model solutions individually before sharing, the process ensures that no single person's voice dominates the initial creative phase
• Improve Understanding: The sessions help groups improve their understanding of complex systems. Each participant "tells the story" of what they modelled, it allows the rest of the group to see exactly how their colleagues perceive the system
• Improving Knowledge Flow: Since documentation alone is often insufficient to carry important design ideas, these sessions bridge the gap through continuous, close connection between team members
• Leveraging Diverse Insights: By coming together after individual work, the team benefits from the highest level of insight and combined experience of the group



### Decision Records

#### Overview

The idea behind ADRs is to record _significant_ architectural decisions that is both short and it follows an accepted template. Recording decisions helps with making better decisions, also we end up with a quick reference to understand what has been done in the past. 
They provide a modular way to capture the rationale, context, and consequences of architecturally significant choices. Specifically designed to address the shortcomings of traditional, large-scale documentation in agile environments.
ADRs document the specific forces at play—including technological, political, social, and project-local factors—that influenced a decision

Maintain open and transparent communication inside and outside of our teams

#### Why use this tool, in the context of better decision making

* While code and documentation are often insufficient carriers of complex design ideas, ADRs function as a "conversation with a future developer"
* Record the context of decisions. Maybe you can't go to the full extent of the advice process, but you can start by recording your decisions.  - See this great story  [The Reality of Systems Change: Facilitating Architecture with Transparency](https://virtualddd.com/facilitating-archdes/systems-change-transparency/)
* Documentation quality: modular, version controlled 👍

### Left Hand Column

The left-hand column is a reflective tool developed by Dr Chris Argyris designed to help individuals understand the hidden assumptions and internal dialogues that occur during communication. It is particularly useful for handling difficult conversations, managing awkward meetings, and processing power-related stress.

To use this technique, you typically document a conversation by splitting a page into columns:
* The Right-Hand Column: What was said, facts
* The Left-Hand Column: Your record what you were really thinking and feeling but did not express at the time

The ultimate objective is to become conscious of the dichotomy between words and thoughts

#### Why use this tool, in the context of better decision making

* Understand power dynamics, starting with self awareness. This tool allows you to pause and inspect your reactions and those of others.
*  Improving Knowledge Flow: Decisions require asking the right questions and understanding the problem from multiple perspectives. By inspecting your internal dialogue, you can identify where communication is breaking down, which is essential for knowledge transfer and innovation within a group of programmers

### Influence Mapping

#### Overview

Influence Mapping is a visual tool used to navigate the "decision environment" surrounding a central decision-maker, or "the D". It addresses the ["Sir Galahad Fallacy"](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/charleslambdin_good-work-does-not-go-unnoticed-if-thats-activity-7311063535705300993-zIbO), the mistaken belief that technical facts and "better arguments" alone are sufficient to persuade others. Since architectural choices are often a record of hidden power structures, this tool helps externalise complex socio-technical forces.

Some key steps:
* Listing and Casting: Identifying the authority figure ("D") and categorising stakeholders as Coalition, Opposition, or co-players.
* Rating Metrics: Plotting these individuals on a matrix based on their level of support and their organisational influence.
* Visualising Relationships: Drawing arrows to show influence paths, where line thickness represents "permission", the level of receptivity one person has toward another’s influence.

Ultimately, influence mapping treats decision-making as a "team sport". It allows architects to evolve the broader decision landscape and leverage existing dynamics, ensuring that technical proposals are taken seriously within the organisation’s "social milieu"

#### Why use this tool, in the context of better decision making

* Understanding how power flows
