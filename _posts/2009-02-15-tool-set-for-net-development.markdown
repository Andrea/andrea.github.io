I have 10 minutes to write this, and I ve been meaning to ...

This is a few things that I use (or want to try) :


### **Unit Testing Tools**


[MbUnit ](http://www.mbunit.com/)- Faster to test AR Datamodels 

[NUnit](http://nunit.org/index.php) Nothing bad about it, nothing that made me go **wow!** that's great!  (that i can remember right now)

and of course

[Test Driven ](http://www.testdriven.net/) Just love the fact that you can right click a test, a unit or a project or a solution and just run the test or in the worse case scenario debug the test.


### Mocking Tools


[Rhino Mocks ](http://ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks.aspx) Used it a few times, don't really like it, perhaps because I don't understand it all that well

[Type Mock  ](http://www.typemock.com/)Supposedly easier to use but compromises design

Roy Osherove posted [this ](http://code.google.com/p/mocking-frameworks-compare/)today on twitter. Basically a google code projet to compare differnt mocking frameworks, since this is part of the topics for **alt.net meetup next month** have a look :) 


### DI IoC Containers


[Windsor/MicroKernel](http://castleproject.org/container/index.html)

Windsor is an Inversion of Control container, it helps you decouple your code and by proxy, it makes your code more testable.  IT is pretty obvious I m not gonna go into detail, however I will say I found this to be very useful

[Structure Map](http://structuremap.sourceforge.net/Default.htm)

I havent used this IoC DI tool, is in my wish list and would like to see how it differs from Windsor.


### Commons


**Edit:I **had to add this, [Rhino Commons](http://ayende.com/wiki/Rhino%20Commons.ashx) this includes two things that are very useful, a generic Repository ( i know some peoplea re against this) , the Log4net helper and the IoC helper


### IDE Add Ins


![](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/favicon.ico)I don't think i even have to mention [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/), I really can not code without it :) KeyMap [here](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/documentation/feature_map.html)

In my wish list and from JetBrains as well,  is to test [Team City](http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/),a simple to use CI; an alternative to this is [Cruise Control.net](http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome+to+CruiseControl.NET) , not so simple to set up but open source

 

[Reflector ](http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/)by Red Gate is a handy tool as well. Use it a lot to inspect castle helpers. Reflector was originally developed by [Lutz Roeder](http://www.lutzroeder.com/) ; Red Gate has promised to  maintain a free version for the benefit of the community. I Really hope so.

 

I m doing web development , this obviously means I m using Firebug. I found gotapi.com a really useful site (html, css and js reference amongst others)

Browsers: my default is Chrome at the moment, however I use Firefox and ie ( to test that it works )

No more time for today will continue later .  

Have a Nice Sunday! If you feel like it, what is your tool set?
