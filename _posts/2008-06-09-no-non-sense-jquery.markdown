John Resig [just posted some talks ](http://ejohn.org/blog/building-interactive-prototypes-with-jquery/)he gave and they are so easy to understand that it hurts. I really like the jQuery syntax, ok is a different approach to a JS library than [ExtJs](http://www.extjs.com/), and I like it, unobtrusive and lightweight with loads of plug ins available.  
  
I really like [this grid ](http://tablesorter.com/docs/#Demo)(ok ok it does use a table for layout but hey, looks good and you read the code and immediately know what's happening) .
