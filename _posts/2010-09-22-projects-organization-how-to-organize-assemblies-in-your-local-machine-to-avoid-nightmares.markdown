This is just how I organize folders and projects on my machine, there are endless possibilities , but I saw someone searching for it online and it did took me a long while before I settled on this, so I thought I would blog about it.

This can be a good or bad way of organizing, I think it depends on the kind and number of projects you are working on

Imagine you have a folder that contains the following folders



	
  * **code** (Real code, shipable, or company proof of concepts with its own repo)

	
  * **spike **(test to see if something works, Proof of concepts very basic)

	
  * **third-party** (OSS libraries and frameworks, etc)


Inside my **code** folder, each solution has itâ€™s own **Lib** or **Libs** or **Libraries** folder (eg One Lib folder per solution ). The story is very different in **spike **since I put projects there for stuff I never ever want to ship then I have a shared **Lib** or **Libs** or **Libraries** folder where I put everything I ever needed. In third party I leave as I got from source control .

Inside the Libraries folder I mostly try to keep a folder per project and inside a folder per version, something similar to this

if in doubt copy the assembly, disk space is cheap.
