Hi there

I received an email yesterday confirming I will be presenting "An Introduction to Monorail" in Developer Develop Belfast the 4th of April. I'm really excited with this. 

I just would like to say Thanks to you. And by you i mean people who are reading this :) because possibly you voted for my session.

Now the hard work begins

If you have any suggestions or comments on either the topic or on presentations please do add a comment.

Thanks again

 

Andrea

PS I ll add my slides here in the next two weeks
