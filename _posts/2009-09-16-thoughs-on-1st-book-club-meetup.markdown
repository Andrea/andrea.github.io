The Art of Unit Testing (by Roy Osherove) First Meetup

Its amazing how much you can talk about just one chapter, ok we diverged at some point to related topics, we dreamed about our own Open Source project, again. Anyway, these are my thoughs about the first chapter, after the meeting

Integration testing and unit testing: Â I end up thinking:



	
  * You shouldnt do it inadvertedly.

	
  * Its your responsability as as developer to do certain Integration tests (if you want to make sure that certain services are working as expected, that certain dependencies that you have and you are ok with that are working as expected)


We also mentioned the Demeter Law when talking about building APIs.

Again this inspired me to look at [StoryTeller](http://storyteller.tigris.org/). Some resources I found:



	
  * Jeremy Miller's [post about it](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2009/08/24/how-about-a-storyteller-preview-release.aspx)

	
  * Elegant Code [Podcast](http://elegantcode.com/2009/08/26/code-cast-30-story-teller-with-jeremy-miller/)

	
  * InfoQ [Post](http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/09/storyteller)
