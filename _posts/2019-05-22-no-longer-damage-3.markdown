title: No long term damage. Day 3
categories:
- environmental
---

Day 3 of a week trying to generate the least amount of long lived rubbish by buying renewable or compostable things. My rules are:

* Focus only on things I buy or consume directly.
* From Monday 20/05 till Sunday 26/05 evening.
* Document what I do buy and questions that arise from this experiment.

For previous days:

* [Day 1](http://www.roundcrisis.com/2019/05/20/no-longter-damage-1/)
* [Day 2](http://www.roundcrisis.com/2019/05/21/no-longter-damage-2/)


## Day 3: Wednesday

Commuting by train, tube, bus and taxi(boo)

It seems like I need to find out about the environmental impact of the taxi ride. I guess this goes in the questions section.

Today's hot drinks were either leaf tea or coffee from the coffee machine in the office, no sugar.

#### Lunch time:

Had lunch at a place with table service. So no waste here, The napkins were paper and they were not the hard kitchen towel type, so I think I can count that as compostable. 

I also had table service for dinner.

#### Later and other questions

After lunch I ordered a coffee and it came with this chocolate coated coffee bean that was wrapped in plastic so I asked if they could put it back and explained why (I don't mind if they though I was weird, but I just wanted to make sure they didn't bin it), so I am not counting that as rubbish for today.

Today I bought a potted plant as a gift, the plant had a plastic container. I will count this as my rubbish.
On discussing this with a group they made the point that this plastic has a long life of use, and that since it contains a plant, it carbon offsets itself.

### Long lived Rubbish for today

* one plant pot
* taxi ride (approximately 2+ miles, 25 minutes on the vehicles)

#### Today's questions

* Correct ways to calculate the environmental impact of car rides.
* I assume plastic plant pots are not biodegradable, so what is their impact.

#### TL;DR

* Taxis and car rides in general, I need to understand their impact when it comes to polluting the air (I see this as my rubbish too )
* Hot drinks seem like a very tricky thing to get whilst being environmentally friendly.
