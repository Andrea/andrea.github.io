## CAN bus: High level introduction

* Mandatory in EU since 2001, us 2008
* Runs on 2 wires. CANH (high) CANL (low)
* Uses differential signaling  (some exceptions) 
    * When a signal comes in, CAN raises the voltage on one line and drops the other line an equal amount
    * Differential sinaling is used in environments that must be fault tolerant to noise 
    *  When a bit is transmitted then signal is simultaneously broadcast to both high and low, the sensors check that they match and if they don't the packet is discarded as noise
* The two twisted pair wires require the bus to be terminated on each end. There is a 120-ohm resistor across both wires on the termination ends
* Most vehicles come with the ODB-II connector, aka Diagnostic Link Connector (dlc). It communitcates with the vehicle internal netowrk
