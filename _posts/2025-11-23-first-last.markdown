I ran a workshop at [LAST Conference](https://www.meetup.com/tech-leaders-collective/) on the 21th November. 
It was ny first LAST conference,  it was an a great event however it will be my last. Don't worry! It will be my last one because they have decided to rebrand the conference to be Signal Not Noise.

I hope to update this post soon with my notes and pictures from the talks and workshop I attended, which I really enjoyed. A special thanks to [Michelle Playfair](https://www.linkedin.com/in/micheleplayfair/) for suggesting this conference and the great team making LAST happen: Lisa Jacob and Ed Wong.
