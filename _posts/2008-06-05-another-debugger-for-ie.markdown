We all know how painful it is to debug websites in ie, (particularly 6 what a terrible browser that.... i ll rant properly about it another day) today i stumbled across this little tool call [DebugBar ](http://www.my-debugbar.com/wiki/) it was all great until I installed it in my machine and it doesn't work. (no contextual menus, no nothing)  
 However I ll have to give it a try in another machine as mine is a Vista Home Edition ( yuck yuck) I should be updating to ultimate pretty soon ( hopefully Saturday) when I know I m safeguarded by at least a virtual environment to work in.  
  
  
 All for now if anyone has comments/ opinions very welcome :D
