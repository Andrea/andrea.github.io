Yesterday we had a really nice Ruby Ireland meet up some links

- Rest [link  ](http://netzooid.com/presentations/scalable_reliable_secure_rest.ppt)

- RateMyArea talk[ http://ciaran-lee.com/RMA-rug.pdf](http://ciaran-lee.com/RMA-rug.pdf) 

- google Geo Location API via Darragh [link](http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2008/08/two-new-ways-to-location-enable-your.html) 

 

Follow up on the website and other projects soon

The idea is that the next meet up (would that be teh 13th of January) is a meetup that involves coding.

Thnaks to the people providing the sambos, beers and mince pies and above all the place to have the meeting.
