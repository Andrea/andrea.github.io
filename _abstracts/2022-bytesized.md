# Sharing your (Systems) knowledge with Bytesize Architecture Sessions

It is not trivial to share knowledge about your systems with people in your team. The longer any team-member works in the systems, the deeper the understanding of all the good and the bad that system has to offer, so how do you surface that knowledge?

Some common problem of knowledge sharing sessions:

* They tend to be unstructured 
* It is generally a big bang effort triggered by a time sensitive event 
* Diagraming and modelling are not skills everyone has in their toolbelt.

Bytesize architecture sessions hope to address many of these problems. At a high level the idea is to have short meetings every 2~3 weeks with a well defined goal. The participants of the meeting will have 5 minutes "alone together" to focus on the goal to diagram. After that, they will come to a consensus on what the system is about.

The sessions have the following benefits:

* An homogeneous understanding of the desired system by the team
* At worst, understanding of will increase and participants will have concrete questions.
* Deliberately thinking about architecture with a cadence keeps the ideas fresh in peopleâ€™s mind and helps them think systemically 
* The resulting diagrams become a design tool that is inherently familiar to the team, since they created it.
* The resulting diagrams highlight obvious areas for improvement.
