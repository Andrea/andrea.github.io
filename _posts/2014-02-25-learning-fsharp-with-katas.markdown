For a while, I've been trying to learn functional programming and after a lot of proding I chose to learn F# this year, the reasons:

- I though I should learn Haskell, the ideas behind the language are great.  I learned a little bit, but, when I tried to build something with a UI or web or a game, the dependencies just weren't three. And windows support just doesn't seem to be there. It doesn't mean I'll never learn it, but I just  want to get learning.
- F# has a great community, I am looking forward to learning more so that I can perhaps sometime contribute some code.
- I am a c# developer, using the clr is certainly helpful, and it makes it more likely that I can use the language on a day to day basis. If I do, I'm pretty sure you ll hear about it.

I thought the way to go about it was to do something often, so [functional katas started in january][fk] and I have started to re-write the last kata after a comment on twitter from [Richard Dalton aka DevJoy][dj].
