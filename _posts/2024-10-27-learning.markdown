* [Hartman Proficiency Taxonomy by Maria Hartman](https://marianhartman.com/proficiency-taxonomy) - This is about understanding learning, better. The bottom of the taxonomy being called Thought Leader which ... not a name that works for me, but I can see where the author is going. 

* [How to build and rebuild trust - Frances Fei](https://www.ted.com/talks/frances_frei_how_to_build_and_rebuild_trust?subtitle=en) - Great talk about how to build trust. There are some gems about why being able to be your true self is important and how it links to what I know as [Rhetorical Triangle](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetorical_Triangle).

* [Left-hand Column](https://leadingperformance.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/5.5-Left-Hand-Column.pdf) Created by Chris Argyris. Left-hand Column is a tool that helps you review how you think and feel as you have difficult conversations. The core idea here is to take notes during or after a meeting and record what we think and feel and what we think the others are thinking and feeling. I have referenced this as "Left margin technique" before by mistake, apologies.  

* [Double Loop learning organisations By Chris Argyris](https://hbr.org/1977/09/double-loop-learning-in-organizations) More from the creator of Left-hand column. 

* [Psychological Affordances Can Provide a Missing Explanatory Layer for Why Interventions to Improve Developer Experience Take Hold or Fail By Catherine M. Hicks](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/qz43x) A great paper by Dr Cat Hicks. The paper is about how context makes for success or failure of interventions. Makes sense to me and it's great to see it validated by research  

* [When (â€Œmodular) monolith is the better way to build software ](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/insights/blog/microservices/modular-monolith-better-way-build-software) I want to say that this is like having a name for a nice sandwich (which we do). I remember that we need to communicate these ideas and leading by example doesn't always scale. 


* [Observations on the practice of software architecture - III](https://techlead.net/observations-on-the-practice-of-software-architecture-part-3/) Great article about software architecture practices (it mentions Bytesize Architecture Sessions)

* [Liberating Structures](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/) - A library of ways to collaborate.

* [A lisp programming guide](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/04b2d776-89dc-4ee4-b8f7-5da57632f58b) By Peter Norvig - I mean, I didn't know it existed and it was going to be great, right? It is.


* [How to make small games](https://farawaytimes.blogspot.com/2023/02/how-to-make-good-small-games.html) It starts really well by explaining why this is hard and recommend this read because  I've been to too many wasted game jams.
