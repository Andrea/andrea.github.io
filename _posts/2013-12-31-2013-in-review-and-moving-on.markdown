The WordPress.com stats helper monkeys prepared a 2013 annual report for this blog.

[![](http://www.wordpress.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/annual-reports/img/2012-emailteaser.png)](http://roundcrisis.com/2013/annual-report/)

Here's an excerpt:


> The concert hall at the Sydney Opera House holds 2,700 people. This blog was viewed about **31,000** times in 2013. If it were a concert at Sydney Opera House, it would take about 11 sold-out performances for that many people to see it.

I'm moving the blog over to github, the transition involves more steps than I would like, but still I think it will be worth it. If you want to see how it's going check [here, ](http://andrea.github.io/)this blog at roundcrisis.wordpress.com will stay live until the transition is complete.


## Happy new year!!
