Today is the first day I am using as standing desk as described in [this article][lifehacker]. It's been exciting "building" this.

I used the desk without the shelf for about 4.5 hours two days ago and I was tired (tho I had a long run before that, so that might be the reason). Today is the first full day and I am finding that having the shelf really helps, also I'm feeling less tension in by upper back than usual. I got this square cushion as well for standing on it, and I think it's more comfortable, compared to standing with runners. 

I noticed I tend to shift on my feet at lot, probably that's good for circulation?

After about 3 hours I sat down for lunch (it felt great)

I'll update at the end of the day.
