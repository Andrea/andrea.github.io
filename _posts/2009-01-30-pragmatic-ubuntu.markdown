Through Andy Hunt's Blog ( one of the Authors of The Pragmatic Programer)  I got the Pocket Ubuntu guide for free.

Thanks Andy and thanks to Keir Thomas for making this available in the  [http://www.ubuntupocketguide.com](http://www.ubuntupocketguide.com/faq.html) 

I just went through the first chapter and found out about [Wubi](http://wubi-installer.org/) ( possibly something I will try now  as I like the idea of trying things quickly without having to reboot, installing... no i didnt read much  yet).![](http://wubi-installer.org/images/wubi_logo.gif)


**Edit  installed Wubi and its not a  virtual machine of some sort as I originally though, however its a really easy installer for windows, I intalled it as a program then rebooted and there it was, dual booting without the headaches :D with a full ubuntu desktop, not what I thoough it was but real nice :)**


So far the book looks good, more on it later on. 

Cheers :D
