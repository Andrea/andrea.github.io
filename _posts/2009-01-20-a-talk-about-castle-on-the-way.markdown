Hi
This should be pretty exciting, I m hoping to do a talk in [OSSBarcamp ](http://www.ossbarcamp.com/speakers/)( well not really a talk but  you know) and depending on votes, I might be talking in [DDD Ireland](http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/belfast/ProposedSessions.aspx) too, we will see.

The talk will be on Castle Project, a walk through of a sample application, the main focus on Monorail and Active Record as I saw some other people can cover IoC and DI ( which in itself is a really long talk).

I have still to decide what this app will do, I actually wanted to build something simple but useful, a few ideas but nothing that I go, yeah thats right, suggestions welcome)

I asked some people for advice on this "create a talk"  thing. I think the most sensible answer I got so far is to tell the advantages of using castle first.
