Hi.

As you might know I'm talking at Developer Developer Developer Belfast ( I refuse to call it DDD, in my head that is Domain Driven Design and I want to keep it that way)

There are plenty of really interesting talks ,I'm looking forward to either [Creating extendable applications using MEF](http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/belfast/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=162) or [DDD, SOA, Messaging, Architecture](http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/belfast/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=195) and [jQuery Deep Dive](http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/belfast/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=184) or [A peek at Silverlight 3](http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/belfast/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=194). You can see the complete Agenda [here](http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/belfast/Schedule.aspx)

And you can register to attend the event [here](http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/belfast/Register.aspx). I think there are some places left.

Hope to see you there!

Andrea
