# Understanding the board, not just the pieces

Everyone in a team implicitly makes architectural decisions all the time. Being deliberate about understanding and improving the architecture of your software helps to make better software.

In this talk we are going to take a look at some tools that you can use to do just that: understand the existing systems you work with.

The tools we are going to explore are: Domain Storytelling, C4 diagrams, ADRs, Wardley Maps and Bytesize architecture sessions. What value do they bring? and When should you use them?
