categories:

Day 7, last day of a week trying to generate the least amount of long lived rubbish by not buying non renewable things. My rules are:

* Focus only on things I buy or consume directly.
* From Monday 20/05 till Sunday 26/05 evening.
* Document what I do buy and questions that arise from this experiment.

Previous days:

* [Day 1](http://www.roundcrisis.com/2019/05/20/no-longter-damage-1/)

## Day 7: Sunday

Last day. Today was much more quiet.

Didn't generate any rubbish in the morning. For lunch I was binning this:

For lunch we used a full package of sausages. The label on the package showed no recycling notice, so I had to assume they were not recyclable, however they had an [Fsc label](https://ic.fsc.org/en/choosing-fsc/fsc-labels) giving some idea as to the sourcing of materials. Good to know.

Also used the end of a package of butter. It was hard to see if the package was recyclable or not, but thankfully I had a new one, and it is recyclable as seen on the picture below.

I really like spinach, so I am going to have to think about how to source it, what I produce with my plants is not enough, and everywhere I buy them they come in film packaging, which is not recyclable.

### Long lived Rubbish for today

* Sausage packaging. Not recyclable.
* Butter packaging. Recyclable :D.
* Spinach container. Non recyclable.

#### Today's questions

* What are good alternatives for meat wrapping? Are there any secure alternatives?
* Are there alternative ways to source spinach and other vegetables that come in film wrapping? 

#### TL;DR

* It is good to know about the sourcing of the materials as well as the recycling capabilities. Some packages have [Fsc label](https://ic.fsc.org/en/choosing-fsc/fsc-labels).

This is the end. There is a summary of the week, you can find it [here](http://www.roundcrisis.com/2019/05/23/no-longter-damage-tldr/) I will update that when and if I get new answers to the questions posed.
