Quick post about this little board app. Say you are doing agile and you have the board with cards, why do you need the physical board? head to scrumy[http://scrumy.com](http://scrumy.com/) It s very simple to use and no signup required (love that)

Even at a glance I can see I would miss some things, however It could prove useful to you.

I got to see this because the [masstransit ](http://masstransit.pbworks.com/FrontPage)website has a link to their [scrumy ](http://www.scrumy.com/masstransit).
