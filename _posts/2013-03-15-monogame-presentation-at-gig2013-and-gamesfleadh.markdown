I did a few presentations about [Monogame](http://monogame.net/) in Gaming Reimagined (at what used to [![MonogameLogo512x512](http://roundcrisis.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/monogamelogo512x512.png)](http://monogame.net)be the Landsdowne Road Stadium) and in [Games Fleadh](http://gamesfleadh.ie), if you were there I would really appreciate your feedback (good and bad, please just leave a comment here).

The slides are available [here](https://speakerdeck.com/roundcrisis/monogame-3). I will make the code available soon and update this post. There is a video for it here

During both events there was some pretty cool talks. About both the industry and making games.

During Games Fleadh I Particularly enjoyed listening to Steve Ewart from [Havok](http://www.havok.com/) showcase his many cool demos and the guys from [DemonWare](http://www.deamonware.net/) talk about their experiences in their company and it some of the big games studios.

Kudos to the organizers of both events and Congratulations to all the award winners of Games Fleadh awards: [bitsmith](http://bitsmithgames.com/) got Best Games and an awesome tank.
