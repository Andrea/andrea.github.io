So here are some interesting links with some commentary about programming languages, strategy, etc. Since a lot of the links are not short reads, I'm going to keep it brief.


#### [Rust's Golden Rule](https://steveklabnik.com/writing/rusts-golden-rule) - Steve Klabnik. 

The golder rule referred to is the following

> Whenever the body of a function contradicts the function’s signature, the signature takes precedence; the signature is right and the body is wrong.

And the implications of applying this to language design and also how it affects language usage. It made me think about cognitive loads when programming and how much I welcomed other decisions in other languages. 

Nice to read Steve's writing. I remember watching some of his talks and what I always enjoyed in those is that it's an invitation to think. He shows you what he's thinking and then you are left with more thinking to do, which is absolutely perfect. 




#### [The outcome of the strategy becomes culture  by Aleix Morgadas](https://learnings.aleixmorgadas.dev/p/the-outcome-of-the-strategy-becomes)

A series of posts about technical strategy. It's great to see other people's journeys, isn't it?  
I really enjoyed the raw honesty and self-awareness of the post and the transition to new "levels" of awareness and learning strategy.

This post:

* Has a relatable journey
* The author acknowledged they hadn't learn and that they needed to do that (courageous, and also the only way to move forward)
* The author strived to find tools than helped them and,
* With a nice example it highlights how important context is, you can't use the same tools in differnt contexts and expect the same results.

#### [It’s a Feature, Not a Bug: A Step-by-step Guide to Architectural Decisions - Sonya Natanzon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chrjl9ALtKQ) 

I was in attendance when this talk was originally delivered and since then I shared this link multiple times. 
It's a no nonsense, well-structured way to find some common ground when making decisions. Like most processes, it's up to you to find the parts that make sense for your context, and do that. 

Watching thia talk is especially beneficial if you believe your organisation doesn't struggle with decision making, as you may discover unrecognized challenges in your process.


#### [Influce mapping series - Charles Lambdin](https://charleslambdin.com/2021/12/14/influence-mapping-part-1/) 

Not only this is a well written series of articles, influence mapping is a super useful tool. 

It's takes a bit of reading but I think it's worth it. Not all the examples are ones I would use, however I did enjoy how the larger examples mapped to ideas of what you can do in your situation. 

At some point while you read this you might feel rather _Macchiavelian_ but if that is the situation you are in, you might as well have some idea about what tools to use **and** what tools others are using. 

Like most people, I started reading this series on part three. The  hook, that kept me reading the series of posts was the many references to other resources. 

## Resources for later in the week

* [An Introduction to Residuality Theory by Barry M O'Reilly](https://virtualddd.com/sessions/83) Heard great things about this and I am going to be missing this at the London DDD meetup so, need to catch this up.

* [Migrating long running workflows across clouds with zero downtime](https://www.inngest.com/blog/migrating-across-clouds-with-zero-downtime) I have dealt with a similar problem before, curious.
