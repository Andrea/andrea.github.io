It is not everyday that I really really need to learn from a book, when I got "Game AI pro" I really needed to learn as much as possible about practical usage of Behaviour Trees, and it really didn't disappoint.

## General Review

These series of books by CRC really show a high level of production.
It can look as an intimidating book at first, the book is a compilation of articles from different authors, the quality and depth varies but is generally high.

Having the article on chapter 2 about Neurology was cool to read. It went into more detail than in general in these types of books.

I wasn't really interested in Randomness so I am afraid I don't know how useful those articles are because I skipped them.

I was really interested in all the articles related to Behaviour Trees because I was trying to create some implementations of this. There is a few introductory chapters that are well written, that explain some options on how to organize your AI. I had to read "Simulating Behavior Trees: A Behavior Tree / Planner Hybrid Approach (Daniel Hilburn)" many times, there was new concepts that I wasn't familiar with but it really got me thinking (so many times I would start reading, follow my though path, forget what I read... had to start that section again).The sample code was neatly organized, out of all the authors, perhaps this is the one I would find more useful to have a chat over a beer (and hopefully close to a white board, just in case).

Some of the code samples are great, others give you something without enough context.

If you are thinking of buying this book you need to be aware that, like most game development books, there is not as much code as you would expect and when there is it is C++ code.
If you are looking for practical advice about production AI, then this is the book for you.
