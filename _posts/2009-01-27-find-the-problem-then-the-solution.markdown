I found myself making the mistake I read about a lot of times. 

It turns out we have to migrate parts of an existing solution to a different platform and I had all this questions about how to organize the new solution and I realised, hold on, I must first have a deep dive into the existing code and **then** start thinking about the new solution and how to architect it.

I was so easily driven to think about the solution that I lost sight of the problem, terrible and now I m advertising it... 

Maybe it was just the idea of going through the existing code disgusted me so much that I didn't want to think about it? or maybe its the fact that reading code is harder that writing it?

Hopefully I learned from it.
