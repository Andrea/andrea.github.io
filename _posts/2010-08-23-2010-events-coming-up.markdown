9th Of October - **DDD Dublin**. An event where there are a lot of developer presentations, presented by developers. The talks are selected by vote (ie not the organizers) , for more info on the series of events, please check [here](http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/home/); the events  in Scotland and Reading in previous years were really interesting , so its worth taking note of the date. I ll update this post when there is more info.
