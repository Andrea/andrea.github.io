  <h1>About</h1>

<p>Andrea is a professional software developer with 20 years of experience. Andrea played a key role in making Kats Conf, Global GameCraft and many other communities a reality. She co-founded BatCat Games, a PC and Console game development company in Ireland. These days she is a consultant / contractor focusing on strongly typed functional languages. </p>
<p>Andrea has been interested in the genesis of the tools she uses for quite some time, which derived into a keen interest into History and Philosophy of Computing. To that effect she researched and gave talks on the subject, such as:
  <ul>
   <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuDm2PPQNMQ">A brief and incomplete history of programming languages - Curry On</a></li>
