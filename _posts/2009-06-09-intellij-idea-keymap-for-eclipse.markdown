I m seriously used to the Resharper key map in visual studio, so when doing Java development I felt a bit handicapped, unfortunately I cant use IntelliJ IDEA (did the 30 day trail and loved it) so after a quick google I found [this](http://www.jroller.com/santhosh/entry/intellij_idea_key_scheme_for). Its not perfect but it works.
