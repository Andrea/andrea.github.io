## Mapping a decision

I will elaborate on the example from [Part 2]({% post_url 2025-11-19-making-of-a-decision-2%}/#applying-dikw-a-practical-example) of this series. 

### Setting the scene

This is a fictional scenario based on some experiences I've have that are close to this. 

**The problem**: A library your organisation heavily depends on has changed its licence and will soon require a large fee for commercial usage.

A setting like this is highly likely to be a little stressful. It is also likely to generate many meetings (some impromptu and others rather formal) and a lot of online interactions (slack, teams chat, email, etc).

I will map here some significant ones. Explain who are the participants and any interesting emerging comments and patterns


### Meeting 0: Initial Library Licensing Change Discovery

Agenda 
* The license change is explained in plain language
* Timeline for enforcement is clarified. 
* Agreement on whether to escalate 
* Agree next steps

## Meeting Summary

* NC, a dev at the TX team shared the news of the change, and learned more about it (details of the licence change, alternatives others started evaluating)
* During a weekly sync meeting I H gave the floor to NC to explain the problem
* CO and CS Present and asked more questions - CO obvs looking at the strategic options company wide
* Not useful comments from LG - the Principal from the MS team. Seems worried about derailing on side project. Confusing and took a lot of time.  
* FJ - The principal from the LS team seemed better informed but she is in bad terms with  both CO and CS
* AT - Product Owner for LS and TX tries to gather more context about immediate impact to in-flow initiatives.
* Pretty much everyone understands we shouldn't panic but we need more info - CS (Eng manager) and AT (Product Owner) will come back to people on who and when can we do this
* A slack channel created 






## A decision viewed as maps 




Mapping is not just about what **you** consider to be accepted knowledge (see [Who gets to know]({% post_url 2025-11-19-making-of-a-decision-2 %}/#the-hidden-barrier-who-gets-to-know) ) worth sense checking to see if others in the community if decision-makers also react the same way.

## Other people testing it, key comments

* Mostly I asked people that have a similar role to mine. Most of us are Principals, Staff+, Architects

Bruno
* Helped me compare the "hierarchy versus the real conversation" 
* Capture a controversial statement and understand the impact
* CxO bomb
    * maps to surface the unspoken rules




### Other uses

* Teaching people that are levelling up. This was mentioned by most of the people trying this tool. 
* Share with others what you think it's happening
* Retrospectives or Project kick-off sessions. I can imagine some scenarios where this might work extremely well, I can also imagine this being a disaster. This is why I advocate this as a solo tool 


## More to do

* ideal for small, close-knit groups but was a bit harder to apply at scale e.g. decisions involving >15 stakeholders and cross-functional groups.
* To investigate, this is a subjective tool. How could it be used along other feedback and data-driven mechanisms? If you are a manager and keen to try this tool and have ideas on how to mix both I am so keen to talk to you 
* Structured guidance on interpretation. So you did the maps but now you are not sure what to do with it? ... giving guidance is hard because people map quite differently
* how to use it in sense checking scenarios? maybe during some particular parts of workshops? what would be good / bad


## Good things about it

* "Effective in highlighting misalignments (e.g., those with power but little knowledge or vice versa) and can serve as a lightweight tool to prompt reflection, guide stakeholder engagement and discussion, and improve collaboration in organizational decisions." - Aaron Sempf, CTO APAC for AWS

* Clear and easy to learn: The core idea is easy to grasp. and does not require deep technical skills or complex software.
* Dynamic Tracking: Repeated use after meetings allowed me to capture evolving dynamics, which is essential in real-world decision processes.
* Encourages Pattern Recognition: Over time, it supported the discovery of a few basic behavioural patterns (and biases of individuals across decisions) and recurring bottlenecks.

## Problems with it

* ideal for decisions with less than 15 stakeholders (too hard to track otherwise)
* It takes time to map, especially when on back to back meetings . Can become a practice when doing it for a specially hairy thing / at the end of the day
* Lack of digital support


## Feedback from others using this tool

I felt it was important to get feedback from others before writing about this tool




#### Why use this tool, in the context of better decision making

* Understand what happened during an exchange (e.g. a meeting). An easy to learn tool that helps evaluate your [ladder of inference][argyris]
* Teach people new to leadership how to navigate decisions. Many people who write code (roles and titles vary) enter decision‑making with a significant level of technical knowledge but limited understanding of how the rest of the decision‑making process works. This tool can help them.


### A brief history

The more time I spent learning about about all these topics, the more others and myself spent time discussing these topics and dealing with everyday problems, I found myself starting to map the relationships between people in a lightweight fashion and it was the brilliant [Dawn]() who helped me realise this was a tool as she said something like I used your map, and then she pointed to  the diagram I ve been drawing over to talk about some point
