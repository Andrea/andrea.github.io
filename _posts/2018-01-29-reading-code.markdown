It has been a long time since I posted anything here. 

I recently had the pleasure of giving a talk at [Middlesex University](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/), for students at the 
start of their CS degree. It was a really nice experience.

I was wondering what would be useful things for them to hear and wound up talking to them a little about:

* Languages/runtimes: Pascal, Delphi, VB, .net and the JVM.
* OO and FP
* Tooling and how much it changed over time

and then I mentioned a few things that I _think_ I would have liked to know:

* The importance of learning to read code.
* The importance of learning to debug code.
* Context is what makes a solution good (or bad).
* Side projects help you learn a lot.

These are things that sound really obvious in retrospect, I do wonder what it sounded like to them.
