PDF Readers  
  
I'm thinking about a serious of "meaty" post for this weekend or at least the one decent one, but meanwhile I though I should post about the incredible difference in speed between Adobe Reader and Foxit. A friend of mine (_one of the two subscribers to this blog_) told me about foxit like a year ago, I went yeah yeah but then about two weeks ago I actually download it and it is really fast, I love it.  
  
FF2 vs FF3  
OMG I'm so happy with FF3 I'm still testing it in only one of my machines but so far much better performance and now that firebug is behaving, happy days. The Add ons I have are: Firebug with YSlow, Jiffy, Web Developer, and of course Google Toolbar. The best feature is no memory problems :D  
  
Now tempted to install the Beta 2 of IE8....
