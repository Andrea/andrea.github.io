So there is another DDD event the 5th of June, and this time is in Bristol, call for speakers is on ( if you want to submit, you can get instructions on how to do so [here](http://dddsouthwest.com/ProposedSessions/tabid/69/Default.aspx))

Sessions look interesting so far.

I really enjoyed the last DDD in Reading, Uk.
