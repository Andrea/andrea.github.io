For the first post of the year, a short post on something I keep forgetting, hopefully it will help someone else.

With [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/), a performant fork of [Atom](http://atom.io/), if you want to use F\# then 
you are probably using [Ionide-fsharp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fsharp) extension with [Ionide-FAKE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fake) and [Ionide-Paket](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-paket). 
Some aspects of these extensions make this really easy to use for  people who are used to the F\# environment, but slightly less to the person starting off on F\# on a *\nix system for the first time.

### Such cheatsheet

 * `Alt+enter` to send to F\# interactive is a great example of something really useful that if you have used F\# on Visual Studio you 
   will definitely try this, but if you haven't, you probably never will until someone tells you about it.
 * In Atom and VS Code you can press Command + P (on mac) or Ctrl+P on Windows and it will bring up the `Command Palette` (you get 
   something like this on Sublime as well) once there enter `>` and then `fsi` or `FAKE` - the `>` character is the key to this working. I keep forgetting about this because I don't use vscode often.
   This is what it should look like:
