This series covers the topics described in [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ie97Oe-t8Wk). This is part 2 of the series about decision making in software systems.

* [The Making of a Decision - Part 2 - Knowledge]({% post_url 2025-11-19-making-of-a-decision-2 %})
* The Making of a Decision - Part 3: Tools for Decision Making - This article
* More coming soon


Part 1 of this series explored how power shapes organisational and architectural decision making by reviewing definitions, laws of power and more. Part 2 covered concepts relating to Knowledge concepts and useful models. It's time to see how these concepts can be used in the context of tools.

When I did the talk that triggered this series I started off by pairing the problems I mentioned at the start of the talk and closed the talk with tools that can help address (or at least be aware of) the issues in a more nuanced way. 

* talk about the issues in a more nuanced way? 
* talk about the tools selection process - mention that there are more tools :D one paragraph top

* Overview of all the tools - include Decision KP Map

There are many tools, I'm selecting some to bring focus and awareness to them in the context of the topics discussed in the series.
When I mention a tool, I will give an overview , explain how these tool relates to the topics discussed and provide links to more in depth research, these are threads for you to pull.

The big idea behind this 
> The Rule: anyone can make an architectural decision.
