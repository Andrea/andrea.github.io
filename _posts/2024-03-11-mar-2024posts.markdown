In this post we go look at dealing with ambiguity, a high level of what is OODA loops, getting better at debugging , and other  posts.

On a bit of a tangent, I wasn't sure how to approach posts from newsletters (some of them behind paywalls). I decided that if I am able to archive it, then I will include them.


#### [Being a PM at Microsoft: Thriving in ambiguity -  By Matthew Roche](https://web.archive.org/web/20240212173446/https%3A%2F%2Fssbipolar.com%2F2024%2F01%2F29%2Fbeing-a-pm-at-microsoft-thriving-in-ambiguity%2F)

This quote is why I wanted to share this article with you

... and the following is another really good quote

![Keep taking action even in uncertainty]({{ site.images }}/2024/ms-pm1.png)

All in all the article has great insight on the task of Project Managers at Microsoft. 


It's great to see the focus on goals. I enjoyed the examples on how to "eliminate ambiguity" by analysing how aligned are the stakeholders. 

Reading about the focus on goals also raises a few questions

* How represented other PMs feel by this article? some of this work mentioned here seems more like the type of work a team lead might do or an Engineneering Manager. 
* Is a lot of the work at Microsoft project based? I thought that was not the case but, if not then how does this focus on goals apply to the team dynamics?

The videos are pretty interesting too and it's a nice touch that they are not just hosted in youtube. Extra internet point to you



#### [What can air combat teach us about software project failure? by Jade Rubick](https://web.archive.org/web/20240214143333/https://www.rubick.com/engineering-leaders-should-obsess-over-feedback-loops/)

If you do programming for a living,  at some point someone metioned OODA loops near this is a handy reference to it.

* **O**bserve
* **O**rient
* **D**ecide, and
* **A**ct

Not only does the post does a high level of what OODA loops are but also it helps with reasoning about why small feedback loops (and the correlated corrections) are more likely to lead to success.



#### [Linux debugging tools you'll love by Julia Evans](https://wizardzines.com/zines/debugging/) 

If you never came across these zines by [Julia Evans aka b0rk](https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk) I think this might make your day. If you want to learn the basics and also in depth about something, these zines are just so so so good, I am linking to a debugging one because I really liked it but all of the ones I read are brilliant

#### [](https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/)

Nice write up with very concrete reasoning. No need to agree with all the points, however great to see how the decision matured.


#### [How we evaluated the impact of GitHub Copilot for 3 months by Tobias Deekens](https://web.archive.org/web/20240311171701/https://commercetools.com/blog/how-we-evaluated-the-impact-of-github-copilot-for-3-months) 

It's what it says in the tin, and it's valuable to learn from the shared experiences of others.
A great adition to this post would be if the surveys included information broken down by programming language and framework. At least in my experience the value you get of CoPilot depends a lot on that.

EDIT: I reached out to the author of this post and it turns out that CoPilot doesn't break down metrics by programming language. 

#### [5 Mistakes That Made My Documents Terrible by Raviraj Achar](https://web.archive.org/web/20240227103008/https://newsletter.techleadmentor.com/p/5-mistakes-that-made-my-documents?r=z1gf1)

This post caught my eye because I could easily relate to the journey the author had experienced. And from there he goes of to suggest how to address the problems. 
The common problems are about mindset, understanding who you are writing for, clarity of message (where clarity includes brevity) and using visual aids when needed.  
 

## Resources for later in the week

* [An Overview of Distributed PostgreSQL Architectures - Marco Slot](https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/an-overview-of-distributed-postgresql-architectures) seems worth a read

* [Book Review: Trust in Numbers - Lorin Hochstein](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2024/02/11/book-review-trust-in-numbers/)

* [systemd by example](https://seb.jambor.dev/posts/systemd-by-example-part-1-minimization/)

* [Futurespectives: learning from failures that havenâ€™t happened yet](https://neil-vass.com/futurespectives-learning-from-failures-that-havent-happened-yet/)


* [Adopting Asynchronous Collaboration in Distributed Software Teams](https://www.infoq.com/articles/asynchronous-collaboration-software-teams/) I'm trying to find ways to run [Bytesize Architecture Sessions](https://bytesizearchitecturesessions.com/) asyncronously and researching options

* [How to Change a Workshop In-Person Game to a Remote Simulation for Effective Results](https://web.archive.org/web/20240212174241/https://www.jrothman.com/mpd/2024/02/how-to-change-a-workshop-in-person-game-to-a-remote-simulation-for-effective-results/)  Started reading one her books and I was impressed, as someone that finds a lot of value in orchestrated collaboration and games, I was intrigued. Also, as above some research material for running [Bytesize Architecture Sessions](https://bytesizearchitecturesessions.com/) asyncronously.

* [Managing mutable data in Elixir with Rust by Mike Clarke](https://web.archive.org/web/20240311165806/https://www.lambdafunctions.com/articles/elixir-and-rust) I scanned this post on the experiment and looks interesting tho I wonder if there are general take aways...I always wonder what happens 3 ~5 years later in these types of projects.
