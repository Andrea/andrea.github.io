hi there  
I don't think this is ultra necessary or anything like that but I know I'll need it at some point, Microsoft has a plug in to save a document as a pdf its well integrated and seems to work ok.  
here is the url [http://url.ie/f9v](http://url.ie/f9v)  
there are other options if you don't have word 2k7 _I think is called pdf95_
