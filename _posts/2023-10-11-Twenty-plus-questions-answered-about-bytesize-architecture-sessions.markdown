I am just back from the [Global Software Architecture Summit](https://gsas.io/#schedule) were I spoke recently about [Bytesize Architecure Sessions](https://bytesizearchitecturesessions.com/). I got some interesting questions in the Q&A. We didn't get through all of them, so I figured I can answer them in a post.

As I answered all of the questions, I realised that there were many ways to answer them, and that in many cases that was very useful too. So, I am going to answer a question or more (if they make sense together) per post, to keep it interesting. 

Below is the list of questions. If you have more questions please send them to me via mastodon or LinkedIn and I can add them to this list.
