On the interwebz today I found an interesting library that somehow I haven't heard of before, and it is a few years old, 
I wonder if the low popularity level is due to it's unconventional name: [Ysppp!][yeppp]

## What is it?

[Yeppp!][yeppp] is a high-performance SIMD-optimized mathematical library for x86, ARM, and MIPS processors on Windows, Android, 
Mac OS X, and GNU/Linux systems. Yeppp! functions are presented in several versions with optimizations for different 
processor microarchitectures. During initialization Yeppp! library detects the processor it is running on, and chooses 
the optimal function implementations. It is also open source with a very friendly commercial licence and has bindings for 
C# (as well as Java, C/C++ and strangely FORTRAN)
