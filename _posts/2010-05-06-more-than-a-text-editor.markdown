Recently I started using Visual Studio 2010, if you follow me on twitter you probably know that this hasnt been a nice transition for me (apologies for the cursing btw)  I ve had many crashes, and I m pretty sure I m not alone, not only a quick search in twitter will reflect this (see image below, the only marked twitt is about a fix for something) , but a some of my co-workers had one or another problem.

It would be naive to think all the issues have the same source, and I know that many are related to the plugins ( I use Resharper with xUnit extensions and AnkSvn). What I m trying to say is that this post is not  to bash Visual Studio,  to be fair the IDE is pretty [![](http://roundcrisis.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/capture.png)](http://roundcrisis.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/capture.png)flashy, shiny, even amazing.... but you know what I want **options**,  something I can rely on and that I can bend to my will. Lets elaborate on that.

Using resharper means I m used to using shortcuts, templates and whatnot,  I know I should be able to bend an IDE to do what **I want** so I can code faster, be focused on what I m doing**. **On the other hand** **I can also see that having a comon IDE within a group means we can share tricks and learn about each other practises.

So today I saw this [post](http://blog.wekeroad.com/2010/05/04/do-androids-dream-of-vim) by Rob Connery and I cant help but wonder, Is Vim the right way to go?, no idea but I know I m ready to give it another try.  However Id iek to set my expectations. I think what I would like is a more modular VS  (where I can turn things off).

Although it s a pain, the **Add Reference Dialog **speed is not my main issue,  it takes so long to add a reference that at least it makes me think "**Do you really want to add that dependecy?**" I would prefer if it wouldnt happen tho.

So, what do I want ouf of my IDE:



	
  * To write code, quickly

	
  * to rely on it, if it crashes, updates, looses references that It handles it elegantly

	
  * To get feedback about the code I write  quickly

	
  * yes to  intellisense , I m a terrible typist (maybe I should change that?) and it helps when you have long explicit variable names (sometimes I go overboard with this until I find better names)

	
  * to be able to change the way the code looks

	
  * to format the code to my will, even if it s stupid, I want to be able to try new things

	
  * to be able to do simple **and **complex refactorings easily and that their result is obvious before we event start the operation

	
  * good ctrl+z support

	
  * to leverage what I know, and induce me to do smarter things, after all the IDE has intimate knowledge about the framework I m using

	
  * that I can carry around my settings (shortcuts, templates, etc really easily)


am I dreaming? Possibly, but lets see whats possible
