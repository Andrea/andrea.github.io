Hi 

I was reading [hanselman's blog](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DoYouHaveToKnowEnglishToBeAProgrammer.aspx) today about languages, not programing languages, but spoken languages like english, spanish, french, chinese, etc.

The post kinda discusses , "**if you dont speak englsih , you are not a programmer**", 

I think the post is worth the read and I have two comments about it.

As native spanish speaker I have to say the fact that I was interested in French from a early age and english later on helped massively when I started programming because I could make sense of things faster. Later on, at college , even thou we had english as a requirement in college, most people couldn't actually read papers properly and they would prefer even badly translated copies

Another thing I have to add is that, a friend of mine, Cristian Espeche, is a great developer, however he still finds it really hard to get documentation and I know he knows  he would be a much better programmer if he could read english, I m mentioning this in my blog to maybe encourage him to learn :) .

I dont know what the solution is yet but I can see this is a problem
