For the first post of the year, I am  writting this entirely for myself, but hopefully it will help some other people.
On [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/), a performant fork of [Atom](http://atom.io/) if you want to use F\# then 
you are probably using [Ionide-fsharp]() extension with [Ionide-FAKE]() and [Ionide-Paket]() some usability aspects of these cool 
extensions make this really easy to use to people who are used to the F# environment, slightly less to the person starting off on F\#.

### Such cheatsheet
 * `Alt+enter` to send to F\# interactive is a great example of something really useful that if you have used F\# on Visual Studio you 
   will definetly try but if you haven't you never will until someone tells you.
 * In Atom and VS Code you can press Command + P (on mac) or Ctrl+P on Windows and it will bring up the `Command Palette` (you get 
   something like this on Sublime as well) once there enter `>` and then `fsi` or `FAKE` the `>` character is the key. (I keep forgetting about 
   this because I don't use vscode often)
   This is what it should look like:
