# Sharing your (Systems) knowledge with Bytesize Architecture Sessions

It is not trivial to share knowledge about your systems with people in your team. Some sharing sessions try to it all at once, or be too long. 

Bytesize Architecture Sessions hope to address many of these problems. At a high level the idea is to have short meetings every 2~3 weeks with a well defined goal. The participants of the meeting will have 5 minutes "alone together" to focus on diagraming. After that, they will come to a consensus with a unified picture.

The sessions have the following benefits:

* Deliberately thinking about architecture with a cadence keeps the ideas fresh in peopleâ€™s mind and helps them think systemically 
* An homogeneous understanding of the desired system by the team
* The resulting diagrams highlight areas for improvement.
* The resulting diagrams become a design tool that is inherently familiar to the team, since they created it.
