[ADA Conf 2024 - Alison Rosewarne Exec Mgr, Architecture at REA Group](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ada-conf-2024-alison-rosewarne-hvjic) A complete review from the conference, with summaries for each of the talks. I was super happy to read:

> Andrea Magnorsky closed out the day with the final talk – on the making of a decision.
>
>Every talk today was fantastic, but I might declare this my favourite as it packed in so much information and also held me riveted right to the end – at 5:20pm on a Friday afternoon!!
