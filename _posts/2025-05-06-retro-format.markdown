The other day I was thinking about how to better capture certain thoughts that come up when you are working through a collaborative modelling session.

So I be been trying a new format:

* 🕳️ Gaps: Is there anything not covered by this representation of the system that you think should be there , or it's not represented well
* 🌱 Growth: Are there some areas here that could give us an edge, alternatively some improvements.
* ✨ Great: Reasons you love this system representation or the system itself.
* 🚌 Grind: (think of the daily grind) aspects of the system / this diagram that feel unnecessarily complicated or hard to use or understand
