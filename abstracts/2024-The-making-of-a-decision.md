# Abstract: The making of a decision


# Raw / unedited

  During my career I stumbled again and again over the (spider?)web that invisibly drives the making of some decisions. If looking at a decision that happened sometime ago, many times I wondered "How did we come to this?" Other times as an unpopular decision is happening, I with others, stand in disbelief while we shake our heads, wondering how can _they_ not see the obvious incoming doom. 
  At the same time, as a decision maker, I've been in the position of making decisions that I hated making and that I had no choice but to make. The best thing I could do is try to be explicit about the context and hope that the future will arrive soon enough to help us course-correct.

  This talk is about the anatomy of a decision, where we'll enquire about it's parts and relationships between the parts. This means we will talk about how we learn about the context of a decision in a socio-technical system, how we create and distribute knowledge needed to make a decision and how influence and power affect us all. 


## Edited version

We often stumble over the invisible webs that drive decision making.  Reflecting upon past decisions, we wonder "How did we come to this?".  Why do others not see the obvious flaws in their decision making?  Have you have been forced to make a bad decision, hoping the future will provide a path to recovery?

This talk is about the anatomy of a decision.  We'll examine its parts and their relationships.  We'll learn about the context of a decision in a socio-technical system, and how we can create and distribute knowledge to effectively drive decision making. Ultimately, we'll better understand how influence and power affect us all.


# Impetus 
 * the role politics and power play in our decision making
 * The unnecessarily poor distribution of knowledge, especially of quality information about the organisation's socio-technical systems
 * The resistance to deliberately focus on knowledge distribution
 * Organisations not realising that what some call "institutional knowledge" is THE most important asset , the thing that will make or break the organisation
