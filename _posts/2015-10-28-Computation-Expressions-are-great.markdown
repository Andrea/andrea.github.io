Lately I have been talking about computation expressions in F# Gotham, 
Lambda World and others before and I have been reluctant to post a blog about
the content because I didn't see a gap on the stuff you can find online, that is 
until now


Computaion expressions are a bock of code that will use a builder to do something out of the ordinary. That blockk of code uses a builder to define the series of operations that can happen within the computation expression, so the builder defines de syntax and semantic 

* maybe
* builder
* sugared vs desugared
* either
* builder
* different possible operations

second post
* cost of using a computation
* can you do custom operations
* how do you combine them
* why can't you nest them
