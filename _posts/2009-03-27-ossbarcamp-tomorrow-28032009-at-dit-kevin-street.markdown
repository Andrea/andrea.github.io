Hi there just a friendly reminder about OssBarcamp

Its tomorrow from 9.30am to 4.30pm

there is a map to the location [here](http://www.ossbarcamp.com/2009/03/27/housekeeping/) (really close to Whelans)

It should be great fun. Looking forward to see Jaime's talk on Git and other talks look really interesting too (jQuery, webdev tricks, etc).  I hope some people will show up to my little talk about Monorail. I ll be uploading the content (slides and samples) this evening (i ll add the mandatory post about it here when I do) . Your questions or comments will be appreciated
