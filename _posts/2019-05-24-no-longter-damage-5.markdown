title: No long term damage. Day 5
categories:

Day 5 of a week trying to generate the least amount of long lived rubbish by not buying non renewable things. My rules are:

* Focus only on things I buy or consume directly.
* From Monday 20/05 till Sunday 26/05 evening.
* Document what I do buy and questions that arise from this experiment.

Previous days:

* [Day 1](http://www.roundcrisis.com/2019/05/20/no-longter-damage-1/)
* [Day 2](http://www.roundcrisis.com/2019/05/21/no-longter-damage-2/)
* [Day 3](http://www.roundcrisis.com/2019/05/22/no-longer-damage-3/)
* [Day 4](http://www.roundcrisis.com/2019/05/23/no-longer-damage-4/)

## Day 5: Friday

Working from home again today.

All food an drink consumed today was bought before the start of the week or not by me, so I figured I would document anything I put in the bin.

#### Lunch time

I had a salad that I prepared myself, I used the last of some nice spicy beetroot. The container was clear plastic which is "widely" recycled, not so for the fork (or at least not mentioned) nor the film covering it. There was a note about how you can bring this to a big store, my nearest one is about 5 miles from here, which I would probably have to drive to, especially If I am buying more food there.  I wonder if the home delivery would take this instead.

#### Later and Questions

I cooked from this evening. There was:

* Ham wrapper, I think that is not recyclable.
* Oranges net. Also it appears it's not recyclable
* Chips bag. Not recyclable.

Pretty sad.

### Long lived Rubbish for today

* Ham wrapper, I think that is not recyclable.
* Oranges net. Also it appears it's not recyclable
* Chips bag. Not recyclable.
* Film and fork from beetroot container.

#### Today's questions

* Can anything be done about these things that are not recyclable? How could we upcycle them?
* I heard (but not researched yet) that there is some rubbish you can bring back to where you bought it and they will deal with it, but I don't understand if that is true or what does "deal with it" means? 

#### TL;DR

* Quite a lot of rubbish for one day.
