Just a quick post :

If are trying to use Format, in GWT, String.Format  is not supported, instead you should use [Format ](http://gwt-ext.com/docs/2.0.4/com/gwtext/client/util/Format.html)a lot of interesting stuff there, so if you are using GWT-Ext take 5 min of your time and have  a look, you ll end up using it.

This is what I m using for Strings and for dates
