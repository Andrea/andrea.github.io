The most interesting thing today was an email from Manning with the new release of the EAP of Nhibernate in Action (still in chapter 3 :( ) .  
On the plus side, first time I ever bother reading the table of contents in detail, and yes, I found an appendix called Introducing ActiveRecord and MonoRail, at first this made me really happy, but now that I think about it, the appendix should really only be about Active Record, else its gonna be too short.  
I think I would like to see a mention of Machine Migrations (and similar tools)   
  
PS: Did I just say this is the most interesting thing in the day ? ( well apart from lunch in the park yeah, it pretty much was)
