I saw some incoming links from [curiouswines.ie](http://curiouswines.ie) and I though I would clarify I m not a [wine **_connoisseur_**](http://www.google.ie/search?hl=en&rlz=1C1CHMG_enIE291IE304&ei=h2WRSbGmKZWN-gaqxemJCw&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=1&ct=result&cd=1&q=wine+connoisseur&spell=1)  (I ll keep trying tho :D) however, the word does remind me about WINE, the translation layer that allows windows applications to be run on Linux.

[](http://www.winehq.org/about/)Please note WINE stands for Wine Is Not an Emulator, hence not paying the penalties of one.  It looks like this is mostly for games, thou Photoshop and Autocad are supported (with minor issues) I dont really need either right now but you never know when you are going to need one.

For the more conventional wine (ie the one to drink), i think you better to talk to the guys down in Cork, [ curiouswines.ie ](http://curiouswines.ie/).
