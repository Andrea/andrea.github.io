Hi all
just though I' d  advertise the fact that [rubyjobs.ie](http://rubyjobs.ie/) is live.

I m really happy with this, Its great to see the community releasing things. Ok its very basic but I think is a really good start.
Most of the effort came from Gavin Joyce, but Declan and other people (that I cant remmeber right now, sorry no memory ) contributed to the project; it is open source andÂ [hosted in github](http://github.com/GavinJoyce/rubyjobs/tree/master).

It all started last meetup and It will sure continue on the next one , that is the 13th of January @ 7pm in 10 Upper Fitzwilliams Street.

Thanks again to [IGO People ](http://www.igopeople.com/)that kindly provides the meeting room :) and they also launched very recently.
