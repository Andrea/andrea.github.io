I have mentioned FAKE (aka F# Make) in pretty much all the talks I have done so far, however I never explained some of the key aspects of this amazing build DSL.

FAKE is a is a build automation system with capabilities which are similar to make and rake. 
The DSL includes support for: 

  * building with MsBuild + xbuild
  * Testing with nUnit, xunit,  MSpec
  * Creating nuget packages
  * Ziping resulting files
  * [More!](http://fsharp.github.io/FAKE/apidocs/index.html)
