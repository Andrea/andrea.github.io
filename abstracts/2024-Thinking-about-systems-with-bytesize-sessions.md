## Thinking about Systems with Bytesize Architecture Sessions

People building a system need to have a high level of shared knowledge.
They need to know not just what to build today, but what the system should look like in the near future.
Generally, the goal of the system is a bit of mirage, with blurry edges. Each of us have an idea of what it is we are building, is it the same idea?

Sharing knowledge effectively is hard, in this talk I will present a technique called **Bytesize Architecture Sessions**.  It is a workshop format that improves knowledge sharing of systems.

Some of the benefits of Bytesize Architecture Sessions are:

* Improved systems thinking.
* Enriching collaboration within the team.
* Understanding architecture practices and tools in a safe environment.
* A feedback loop controlled by the team that produces better documentation across sessions.
* Revealing the Bermuda Triangles!

Take away points:

    Sharing knowledge effectively is a key activity for effective creation and improvement of systems
    Bytesize sessions is a workshop format that helps with knowledge sharing
    When knowledge is congruent within a team, it is easier to communicate
