My dad asked me to help him do a website, so I started looking at the options, I definitely do not want to maintain this at all I thought.

He said: I just want an info page. 

And I though about [Ana Nelson](http://ananelson.com/) and her recent talk in Ruby Ireland about how to regenerate documentation[update: jsut been to her site and she moved her blog to webby :D], so 15 min ago I was trying [webby](http://webby.rubyforge.org/), and its **great**, its a framework that does exactly what a framework should do: save you time but does things properly.

From my 15 min experience I can see that Its super easy to use, It generates a web structure quickly,  it's template based and does loads of smart things for example: 



	
  * In the css you can define "variables" with, for example, colours ( always thought this was necessary but also I think variables shouldn't be implemented in the css definition)

	
  * you can output to other formats ( in my case pdf output is really handy )

	
  * **goodness**. Because Webby is a wrapper around rake, you can simply deploy to a site server 


I ll see what else I can use, but I really like it because it allows me to do something I m happy with very quickly and that means that I m actually waiting for my dad to send me the pictures and remaining content so i can deploy this site :p.

Also it gives me room to add some eye candy, I was reading this related [post ](http://short.ie/ahm60t)and really liked it too.
