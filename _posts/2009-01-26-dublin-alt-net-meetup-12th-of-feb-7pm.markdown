Hi there: 

As a new chapter of [this post](http://roundcrisis.com/2008/08/27/from-code-monkey-to-code-crafter-ftw/) finally we are doing an  [Alt.net meet up](http://dublinalt.net/2009/01/23/meet-up-12th-of-february-7pm/), I can t wait and hope for the best.  The meet up will be the **12Th of February at 7pm in The Duke** (off Grafton Street). Unfortunately we didn't realise it was on the same day that twestival ( a charity event for twitterers) I think we are very different events, thou i m sorry I ll be missing it, as it is a worthy cause.

I like the definition of Alt.net I found in [David Laribee's blog](http://laribee.com/blog/)


> What does it mean to be ALT.NET? In short it signifies:

> 
> 
	
>   1. You’re the type of developer who uses what works while keeping an eye out for a better way.
> 
	
>   2. You reach outside the mainstream to adopt the best of any community: Open Source, Agile, Java, Ruby, etc.
> 
	
>   3. You’re not content with the status quo. Things can always be better expressed, more elegant and simple, more mutable, higher quality, etc.
> 
	
>   4. You know tools are great, but they only take you so far. It’s the principles and knowledge that really matter. The best tools are those that embed the knowledge and encourage the principles (e.g. Resharper.)
> 




I think we might be comming late into the party, however I m not interested on how are we called, I see it mostly as a way to learn and exchange ideas, solutions. Hope we can get talking about interesting topics and that we can come up with a plan for the next meet up.

Anyway, hope to see you there :), if you have any suggestions or comments you are very welcome
