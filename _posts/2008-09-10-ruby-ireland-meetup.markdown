I was in ruby Ireland last night ( good turn up btw) and it was great to see Paul Campbell talking about [Couch Db](http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/), a non relational DB in their own words  
  


> "Apache CouchDB is a distributed, fault-tolerant and schema-free  
document-oriented database accessible via a RESTful HTTP/JSON API. Among other  
features, it provides robust, incremental replication with bi-directional  
conflict detection and resolution, and is queryable and indexable using a  
table-oriented view engine with JavaScript acting as the default view definition  
language."  


  
  
Anna showed some interesting rake tasks and i did a short intro to jQuery (slides [here](http://www.slideshare.net/roundcrisis/jquery-presentation)) hopefully someone found it interesting.  
  
This Saturday the 13Th  is the open coffee meeting in the New York Grind that will include the talk about trying to come up with something similar to alt.net Ireland. as discussed in [previous post](http://ohmygodiamacat.blogspot.com/2008/08/from-code-monkey-to-code-crafter.html)  
  
And the universe didnt disapear (aparently) thumbs up.
