Hi all:

Just thought I d post here that a group of us in Dublin. Alt.Net are organizing a coding day the 24th of April in UCD, it should be a fun day of hacking some code. One of the really cool things is that James Gregory will be there talking about Fluent Nhibernate.

If this sounds like something you d'like to do you, can Â register and find out more about it in [codingday.org](http://codingday.org)

Cheers
