I needed a psd content processor and found one [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnhar/archive/2009/05/21/photoshop-texture-importer-redux.aspx) it is based on the [EndoEngine](http://www.endogine.com/CS/). The one available depended on XNA 3.1,Â  I did some clean up on the project and made it available via my account on [github. ![](https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com/images/error/angry_unicorn.png?1334862345)](http://github.com/Andrea/Photoshop-Content-Processor-for-XNA)

We (at [BatCat Games](http://www.batcatgames.com)) are working on a Content hot loader that will be available open source soon (at the moment it doesn't really work ) it will probably include this content processor.

The code comes with a sample game that displays a Photoshop file as a texture.
