* [Is It Time To Version Observability? (Signs Point To Yes) By Charity Majors](https://charity.wtf/2024/08/07/is-it-time-to-version-observability-signs-point-to-yes/) 

* [Shorthand and Markup for Speedy Note-Taking - Olaf Zimmermann ](https://web.archive.org/web/20230731234121/https://ozimmer.ch/authoring/2020/07/02/ReviewAndMeetingMarkup.html) I thought this was going to be a lot shorter than this. I already use something similar to this but not as consistently as I would like.


* [Learning Systems Thinking by Dian Montalion](https://learningsystemsthinking.com/) I had the good luck of not just meeting Diana but do a workshop together on Systems Thinking at the GSAS. 

* [Facilitating Software Architecture By Andrew Harmel-Law](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/facilitating-software-architecture/9781098151850/): I have read most of the book and also doing a [book club](http://virtualddd.com/book-club) on it. I'm not sure how much useful can I say here except that it's made me think about how I would like to work a lot.
