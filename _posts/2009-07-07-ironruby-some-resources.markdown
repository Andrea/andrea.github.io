I found some interesting IronRuby Resources that I thought some people might find useful:

[http://blog.jimmy.schementi.com/](http://blog.jimmy.schementi.com/) complete Articles on Iron Ruby, I think he is somewhat related to the IronRuby project ( never really  read the profile, just the articles....)

[http://flanders.co.nz/](http://flanders.co.nz/) Blog from Ivan Porto Carrero, the Author of [Iron Ruby in action](http://manning.com/carrero) ( its on EAP from Maning).

[http://blog.benhall.me.uk/](http://blog.benhall.me.uk/) Ben Hall's Blog. He s got some really complete articles in that blog, and a really good speaker. He wrote this article  on [IronRuby and RSpec](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd434651.aspx) on the MSDN magazine.

[http://www.ironruby.net/Documentation](http://www.ironruby.net/Documentation) Of course :D

[http://www.iunknown.com/](http://www.iunknown.com/) John Lam, I believe he is responsible for this project, however he doesn't blog too often.
