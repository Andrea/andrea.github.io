I have moved my blog from wordpress to Jekyll. It was a process a little bit longer than I expected and I am not done with it, but I'm glad to have started the process.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].
