Hi. at some point we all need a click time picker, found [this ](http://ajaxian.com/archives/nogray-visual-time-picker)one (in ajaxian)  
  
Also in Ajaxian, I found a PNG fix I used the sample and it works, however I can't make it work on my server, it doesnt even hit the *.htc file.  
The instructions say that you should give the path to the htc relative to index.html however I dont seem to be able to get it up and running for my web app, anyway... will try again with a little bit more time later on.
