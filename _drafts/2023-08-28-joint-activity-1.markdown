## Why I care about this paper

Since I been developing the idea behind Bytesize Architecture Sessions I've been more and more curious about what makes collaboration happen in more efficient ways. 
I came across this papper as a suggestion for the [Papers in Systems](https://github.com/Andrea/PapersInSystems) sessions that happen online montly. Of course, I felt compeled to be involved.


## Overview

This paper tries to explain how a joint activity happens and what are the components of succesful coordination. It also describes the constituents parts of coordination in different scenarios (some where people know each other: team sports, some where they don't: traffic)

The paper starts off describing the interactions between two doctors and how, with two phrases they are able to convey a lot of information. How is this possible?

Clarks' previous work is on conversations. Conversations require a lot of coordination, and they change depending if this is someone we've just met or known all our lives.  Conversations are undirected. This paper extends that work with a range of coordinated activities.


At this point we are provided with some definitions:

Coordination 
* (Olson, Malone, and Smith (2001)): Coordination is managing dependencies between activities 

* Zalesny et al. (1995): "The complementary temporal sequencing (or synchroniciyy) of behaviors among team members in the accomplishment of their goal." 

* Klein (2001): "CoordinaTion is the attempt by multiple entities to
act in concert in order to achieve a common goal by carrying out a script they all understand." (p. 70)


However these definitions are not sufficient, some address goals leaving aside the interdependencies of how the goals interact and conflict. Also, what happens when the parties don't have a common goal, they just cooperate so that they can achieve their individual goals. A definition of coordination by the authors is to follow.


A joint activity is described by three parts

The **criteria for joint activity** are that the parties intend to work together, and that their work is interdependent, rather than performed in parallel without need for interaction. If these criteria are
to be satisfied, the parties to the joint activity have to fulfil **requirements** such as making their actions predictable to each other, sustaining common ground, and letting themselves be directed by the actions of the other parties. The form for achieving these requirements — the **choreography of the joint activity** —is a series of phases that are guided by various signals and coordination devices, in an
attempt to reduce the coordination costs of the interaction.

The paper is rather long, at the same time there is a lot to cover. Because of this I've decided to split this review into several parts, matching the parts of the paper

* Criteria for Joint Activity
* Requirements for Effective Coordination in Joint Activity
* The Choreography of Joint Activity
* The Fundamental Common Ground Breakdown
* Making Automation a Team Player


## Criteria for Joint Activity

Criteria for a joint activity: the parties have to intend to work
together, and their work has to be interdependent.

* Many reasons for joint activity
* JA requires a **Basic Compact** , a commitment from all parties to support the process of coordination
