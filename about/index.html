  <h1>About</h1>

<p>I ended up as a Software Developer, I am pretty sure there was no other viable option.
My current technical interests are F#, Scala and other programming languages, games and philosophy of computing .
</p>
<p>
I really enjoy finding different ways to write code, sometimes for performance, other times for succinctness, sometimes, just because you can, there is no better way to learn than trying.</p>
<p>When I am not working I tend to play with Haskell or other languages or cats </p>
<p>Conferences and meetups are a great way to learn more, so I try to help when I can to make them happen. For that reason I co-organise Functional Kats and GameCraft. I also speak at local and international conferences like CodeMesh, Progressive.Net, ProF#, Lambda Days and many more.</p>
