It is not uncommon when learning about systems and making sense of them to hear the parable about the blind people and the elephant, it's a story about a group of blind people who have never come across an elephant before and who learn and imagine what an elephant is by touching it. 

As I spend more time running Bytesize Architecture Sessions and thinking about systems in general I am coming to the (not so surprising?) conclusion that the act of sharing knowledge successfully is an inextricable part of building systems.



If we needed a metaphor for the act of building systems it would be:
A group blind people imagined something like an elephant, maybe someone even heard about elephants once.

After some consideration they decide they want to build the elephant, it takes time and effort, at some point "it goes live".
