I think the best way to describe this is saying, When is the next one? (We think around late August, early September)




Thanks again to our sponsors: Jetbrains, Manning and Microsoft, and particularly to our hosts: the open source Lab in UCD, that place is just designed for this type of events.




Sessions:




- Rx :




- ook!




- Cucumber with Iron Ruby




- pLinq and Mono




- Mongo Db (a bit of a comparison between .net implementation and a ruby implementation)




All the code for the sessions is available in our repo.
