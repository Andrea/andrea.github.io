A reading diary is my way to discuss with myself what I think about the book as I read it. It probably has errors of different kinds. 

 

Some notes on the remaining of Chapter 1

 

  
  * F# intro, how its mostly functional but supports some OO features 
   
  * How C# incorporates functional ideas. 
   
  * Reading about declarative programming, these made no sense             
    * Definition of declarative programming style. Logic without the details… mmm ok lets see how this goes 
       
    * Functional means not only we can add new commands but also new structures 
       
   
  * Code, finally a code example came about and it was all cleared up 
   
  * Concurrency friendly application design, I was expecting the how but I got a birds eye. Patience 
   
  * The section on how functional style shapes your code is cool, as it details how your code will (hopefully) slowly change. It highlights             
    * the fact that OO design is still useful, 
       
    * it helps simplifying some patterns 
       
    * make the code more readable (this I m not so sure about, I’ve read code from people who started learning functional programming and on my view the code was less readable and harder to follow, particularly on tests) 
       
   
  * Section 1.4 is all example based. Not mad about the fact they used WPF for one of them(not a fan), but no biggie, it gets the point across anyway . The author obviously wanted the reader to understand what declarative and imperative means and understand the difference 
   
  * I can start to see how this style of programming could be really beneficial 
   
  * Got as far as the recursion samples with C# (2.2.3)
 

 

That’s all for today. It’s been hard to find time to read up on this.
