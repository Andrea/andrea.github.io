title: No long term damage. Day 4
categories:

Day 4 of a week trying to generate the least amount of long lived rubbish by not buying non renewable things. My rules are:

* Focus only on things I buy or consume directly.
* From Monday 20/05 till Sunday 26/05 evening.
* Document what I do buy and questions that arise from this experiment.

Previous days:

* [Day 1](http://www.roundcrisis.com/2019/05/20/no-longter-damage-1/)
* [Day 2](http://www.roundcrisis.com/2019/05/21/no-longter-damage-2/)
* [Day 3](http://www.roundcrisis.com/2019/05/22/no-longter-damage-3/)

## Day 4: Thursday

Working from home today. This should be interesting.

All food an drink consumed today was bought before the start of the week or not by me, so I figured I would document anything I put in the bin.

#### Lunch time

I had a salad that I prepared myself, some of the spinach you see there are from self-grown. There was just compostable waste left behind.

I was feeling peckish later and I had a few biscuits, this resulted in an empty package (no I didn't eat them all then and there, promise), as I read it I found a reference to [Terracycle](https://twitter.com/terracycle) however when I went to try to use it for the specific brand there was nothing. This is sad, but I ask them on twitter maybe it is just their UX.
*Update* I asked McVities *and* Terracycle. Lets see what happens

#### Later and Questions

Food that we already have at home.

### Long lived Rubbish for today

A biscuit wrapper.

#### Today's questions

* What are good options to recycle food wrappers in general and biscuits wrappers concretely?

#### TL;DR

* Yay for food you can grow yourself. Even if it is just a small percentage of what we eat.
* It is looking like it is really hard to dispose of biscuits wrappers, there is a way to reuse(?) them some how via Terracycle, but I was not able to find out any specifics as to how to do this exactly.
