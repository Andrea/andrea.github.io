hi there  
I dont think this is ultra necesary or anything like that but i know i ll need it at some point  
Micro$oft has a plug in to save a document as a pdf its well integrated and seems to work ok.  
here is the url [http://url.ie/f9v](http://url.ie/f9v)  
there are other options if you dont have word 2k7 _I think is called pdf95_
