## Title: Learn modeling by doing! Bytesize Architecture Sessions and C4 together.

## Description:
As Donella Meadows said, "Systems happen all at once." This is why modelling is such an effective tool for both individual thinking and collaborative problem-solving. Whilst learning to model can initially seem daunting, itâ€™s a valuable skill to acquire. Let's demystify it!
In this workshop you'll learn to model a system using C4. This modelling technique is a staple of software architecture as it's relatively easy to learn and extremely powerful. C4 focuses on modelling at different abstraction levels.
We'll drive the workshop with Bytesize Architecture Sessions.
