I m doing a lighting talk about jQuery and ExtJs (maybe mention GWT) in the next Ruby Ireland on the 9th of September [link](http://tinyurl.com/6q5n9p)

I ll add a link to the slides as soon as i finish them, **any suggestions very welcome**.
so far i m doing a quick intro, some of the features, stuff i found useful or interesting or use with code samples and finally some links. For jQuery I m touching on ui.jquery and themeroller and the event observer implementation [link](http://almaer.com/blog/enjoying-the-observer-pattern-with-custom-events)

For ext again intro and show some code and then maybe touch on EXT (GWT implementation of EXT Js) just started to have a look at this but it does seem very promising

Cheers
