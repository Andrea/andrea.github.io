  <h1>About</h1>
  

<p>I am a software consultant focusing on Software Architecture and Functional programming. For over 20 years I've worked in many different types of systems with different technologies, it has been fun. During that time I created a collaboration tool called <a href="https://www.roundcrisis.com/2021/09/28/bytesize-architecture-sessions/" target="_about"> Bytesize Architecture Sessions</a>. </p>
  
Along the way I played a key role in:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170120102503/http://www.katsconf.com/"> Kats Conf</a>. A programming conference that ran twice in Dublin </li>
  <li> <a href="https://www.gamecraft.it/"> Global GameCraft </a>. A community that runs game jams, and many other communities a reality. </li>
  <li>In the 2010s I co-founded BatCat Games, a PC and Console game development company in Ireland. </li>

  <li>I've been interested in the genesis of the tools I use so I learned about History and Philosophy of Computing. These are some gave talks I created on the subject:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuDm2PPQNMQ">A brief and incomplete history of programming languages - Curry On</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBu43Tj0zOY">Keynote: Inviting everyone to the party</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
