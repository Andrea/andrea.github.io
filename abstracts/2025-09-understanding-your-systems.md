## LAST conf workshop abstract

Knowledge is spread in ways that might seem chaotic. How can teams have a more cohesive understanding about the systems they work on? What works best in the long run is to make it a practice. That practice needs to be short so that it happens often. Little and often.

Bytesize Architecture Sessions originated from iterating on solutions to this problem across organisations of all sizes and within diverse teams. Seeing how valuable the format had become, Andrea formalised it so that others could try it with their own groups. Put simply, Bytesize Architecture Sessions are a series of short meetings, each concentrating on a narrow slice of a system. A session runs for 45‑90 minutes and follows four clearly defined stages: Session Goal, Alone Together, Consensus and Summary. You may model your systems with whichever tools you prefer.

In this workshop we will review a few guiding principles and then work together through two brief sessions, demonstrating how useful this format can be and the various contexts in which it can be applied.
